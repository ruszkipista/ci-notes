    "# The Flask Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's just talk about what a framework is and how it differs from a regular installable package. One way we can explain this is that when you install a package, it plugs into the code that you've already written.\n",
    "You can use as much or as little of that package's functionality as you need. A framework, however, inverts that control.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a framework, most of the code is already written, and you have to plug your code into it. We could use as an example, building a prefabricated timber-framed house. You order the package pre-constructed and build the framework. It provides the basic structure, but you can still customize it within reason. This allows us to put up a building very quickly with minimal work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web frameworks are similar. They are designed to do much of the heavy lifting for us. They provide the framework, the structure, and allow us to create powerful web applications quickly, but still customized to our individual needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Flask framework, which we're going to look at in our next few videos, is a web-based framework using Python that actually began life as an April Fool's joke back in 2010.\n",
    "Since then, it's become one of the most popular and widely supported frameworks within the Python community.\n",
    "Flask is what's known as a micro-framework.\n",
    "It allows us to get up and running building websites with minimal Python code.\n",
    "We often say with micro-frameworks however, that batteries aren't included, which means that we don't get a lot of features out of the box, like we would with a larger framework such as Django for instance.\n",
    "Flask doesn't come with a default database engine, but the appeal of it, is its simplicity.\n",
    "There are also many extensions we could install that provide the functionality of the larger frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to join the `#template-ninjas` channel on Slack! Catapult your learning of the template languages by joining this channel!\n",
    "\n",
    "The `#template-ninjas` channel is dedicated to all things related to templating languages, which you will be using a lot of as you start using Flask and in the remainder of the course to help you get your data onto the screen."
