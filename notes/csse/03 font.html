<span class="header">The Sneakers Game</span><br> 
In 1934 the 
<span class="giant">New York Giants</span> beat the 
<span class="bears">Chicago Bears</span>, by 
<span class="score">30-13</span>, in nine-degree temperatures [ 
<span class="stadium">at the Polo Grounds</span> ] in a game that has become famous as the "Sneakers Game." With the 
<span class="giant">Giants</span> trailing
<span class="score">10-3</span> at the half, head coach
<span class="coach">Steve Owen</span> provided his squad with basketball shoes to increase traction on the icy turf. The team responded with four touchdowns in the second half to turn the game into a 
<span class="giant">Giants</span> rout. </p>
