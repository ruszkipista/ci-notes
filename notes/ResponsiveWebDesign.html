If you&#39;re developing for the modern web, it&#39;s something that you have to understand. And in this video, I&#39;ll provide an overview of responsive web design. Responsive web design is a web-design method that strives to create websites that are optimized for the viewing experience. This means easy-to-read, easy-to-navigate websites that reduce the amount of user-driven resizing, panning and scrolling. Responsive web design came out of a very real need. The rather sudden appearance of hand-held devices and mobile browsers in 2007 changed the way people accessed the internet. Suddenly, strings of desktop computing were removed and rather than having the sit-in-front-of-a-desktop or laptop computer, people began carrying the web around in their pockets. And web developers had to respond, because that nice-looking website that they designed for a large screen no longer looked so nice when it was loaded on a smartphone or tablet.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c1">Websites responded with mobile-specific websites and while they&#39;re still used today, they really aren&#39;t the best possible solution for delivering web content to mobile devices. In 2010, Ethan Marcotte wrote an article called responsive web design and his insights discussed how designers need to adapt to the medium that&#39;s delivering their content. In terms of websites, there are three main approaches; adaptive websites use media queries to target specific device characteristics. For example, asking the mobile browser to return the screen resolution. Fluid websites used percentages rather than fixed widths allowing the browser to adapt the content on the screen according to the device&#39;s resolution. And responsive websites are designed using a fluid grid and use media queries to control the designing content as its scaled upper-down on the device. Responsive design is the combination of flexible grids, flexible media and media queries. Flexible grids refer to the way a website is logically subdivided. And web designers all know that a web page is essentially a layout of invisible boxes that form a grid. This boxy design has many advantages, but it can all fall apart when a website is forced to be displayed on a small screen. Flexible grids are a method for creating a webpage that can have any number of columns, which scale to any width.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c1">This provides a level of adaptability when a site needs to be shown on a smartphone or tablet. Flexible media is treated in a similar manner. Websites need to be media-rich. But what happens when a website has a large number of pictures or videos and it needs to be displayed on a small device? Well, with flexible media, we can adapt a size of the media to accommodate the screen. Finally, media queries are mechanisms that get the characteristics of a target device, things like the type of device, its screen size, its browser type and version and so on. So we can query a device and get back information like this is Chrome, running on an Android device and here is a screen resolution or this is an iPad running Safari and here is a screen resolution. Using media queries, you can apply how a website is rendered to device using CSS styles that react based on the media query.</span></p><h2 class="c8 c6" id="h.ac3zz6o51l4z"><span class="c16">Fluid Layouts</span></h2><h3 class="c9 c19" id="h.v9kixzopuwcq"><span class="c12 c1">Learning Objective</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">After completing this topic, you should be able to</span></p><ul class="c7 lst-kix_clwmhqcdhey4-0 start"><li class="c20 c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1">contrast fixed and fluid layouts and use proportional width settings to achieve fluid grid layouts</span></li></ul><h3 class="c22 c6" id="h.qqqi8syw9zcl"><span class="c11">Creating fluid grid layouts</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In this video, I&#39;ll discuss fluid layouts. So there&#39;re plenty of benefits to fluid layouts but let&#39;s take a look at a fixed layout first because this is sort of where we came from. This is the, the old way of doing things and it was very typical prior to say, 2007, when smartphones and tablets started to become the big thing. We have mobile devices now that can surf the net. Prior to that however, we didn&#39;t have those constraints. Typically, we would design a website for a desktop or laptop computer and they had certain set screen resolutions. So here if we look, we&#39;ve got a typical fixed layout. We&#39;ve got our widths here, you can see </span><span class="c4 c1">1280px</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c4 c1">1000px</span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;are the width and height of the wrapper. And so if I were to look at this in the browser, go ahead and press F12 here, there&#39;s our fixed layout. Now the layout is just sort of a basic layout here to show a banner, some columns, and down here, a footer at the bottom, and you can see that wrapper in the dotted line around the edges. Now a fixed layout is fine if you&#39;re designing it for a specific screen resolution or something that&#39;s going to be higher than that. But now when we start to talk about smaller devices, like smartphones and tablets, that becomes a real issue.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c21 c1">fixed.html</span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 342.00px; height: 300.99px;"><img alt="" src="images_rwd/image1.png" style="width: 342.00px; height: 316.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 284.11px; height: 261.49px;"><img alt="" src="images_rwd/image6.png" style="width: 284.11px; height: 261.49px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So I&#39;ll go ahead and minimize that, I can go back and take a look. Once again, we&#39;ve got fixed values here. Now here I&#39;ve got a fluid design, again, it&#39;s a very basic design but rather than use actual fixed pixel values, I&#39;m using now percentages. So for example, the wrapper is going to be </span><span class="c4 c1">65%</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and what that means is 65% of the viewport width. So whatever the screen or the browser or size is that window, that viewport is going to change. And here we&#39;ve actually got a fixed height and that&#39;s something that you probably want to take look at when you&#39;re talking about fluid design as well. But for this...for our purposes, I&#39;m just showing us here that we&#39;ve got a fixed height for this layout. Now here we have our various page objects, things like the banner. So the banner, the blue div container here, is actually </span><span class="c4 c1">100%</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;because we want that to span a 100% of the actual live matter layout on the page. But then we&#39;ve got our columns down here and you can see I&#39;ve got </span><span class="c4 c1">50%</span><span class="c1">, </span><span class="c4 c1">24%</span><span class="c1">, and </span><span class="c4 c1">24%</span><span class="c1">. And the reason I&#39;ve done that is so we can get these nice percentages here. So this is going to be half of the width...this green one &ndash; </span><span class="c4 c1">col1</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;which is </span><span class="c4 c1">50%</span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;&ndash; is going to be half of the width of the live layout and these two are going to be a quarter of that. So if I go ahead and bring that up in a browser, okay, you can see there it is. Now the thing about this is that it&#39;s fitting in the screen nicely. We have that white space on the sides, which is typically desirable, you want to have some white space on your layout. Let&#39;s go ahead and take a look at our fixed layout for a second. Now the thing is, I could have designed this so that we would have some white space on either side, that&#39;s not really the issue here. The issue is, if I restore this down to a window...that when I start to resize the page, you can see that our layout is not resizing with it, that in fact what&#39;s happening here is, we&#39;ve got a column over here...the pink column is actually not being completely shown and as I minimize the width of this window, it disappears and the same with the orange column. So this is the problem with fixed layouts where we&#39;re using fixed pixel sizes. On the other hand, in responsive web design when we talked about fluid layouts, if I restore this down, what happens to our &ndash; let me go ahead and shrink that &ndash; what happens to our...our layout is that it&#39;s going to resize as I resize the width of this window. And you can see as I resize it that, that layout keeps on shrinking down and down. Now at some point, it&#39;s going to become unviewable because this, of course, is a really ridiculously low width.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c23 c1">fluid.html</span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 291.66px; height: 261.19px;"><img alt="" src="images_rwd/image5.png" style="width: 291.66px; height: 261.19px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 147.60px; height: 263.26px;"><img alt="" src="images_rwd/image8.png" style="width: 147.60px; height: 263.26px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c1">But think about this as being on a smartphone or a tablet, where the browser width might be something like this, you know? And as we increase the size, there&#39;s our smartphone for example and as we increase it there, maybe becomes our tablet. Then of course, we have our desktop computer here. So we take that into account by using these percentages. And that&#39;s the benefit of fluid layouts where we can actually design things and we start getting into techniques with responsive web design where we&#39;re actually using breakpoints to say, okay, if the screen becomes a certain width or if the browser size becomes a certain width, at this point, we&#39;ll set a breakpoint in and have the...the layout reformat itself according to that screen size and this is the beauty of fluid layouts in responsive web design.</span></p><h2 class="c8 c6" id="h.9ti3leju4lz"><span class="c16">The CSS3 FlexBox</span></h2><h3 class="c19 c9" id="h.uzq0byi7y7gy"><span class="c12 c1">Learning Objective</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">After completing this topic, you should be able to</span></p><ul class="c7 lst-kix_hxhibn9f6fjr-0 start"><li class="c20 c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1">implement the CSS3 Flexbox as part of a responsive design web layout</span></li></ul><h3 class="c22 c6" id="h.7d1gr5i9p543"><span class="c11">Implementing the CSS3 flexbox</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In this video, I&#39;ll explain the CSS3 FlexBox. Okay, so I have a design here, it&#39;s pretty basic. But what we have is two divs, okay, an outside div called </span><span class="c4 c1">container</span><span class="c1">, it&#39;s a class, and an inside div called </span><span class="c4 c1">centered</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and that&#39;s also a class. Now the thing is, it&#39;s exactly how you would expect it to look. I&#39;ll go ahead and run it in a browser, and you see, okay, nothing to it, the div is at the top. What we&#39;d like to do is center it in the page and this is the first value of FlexBox. Now the parent container called </span><span class="c4 c1">container</span><span class="c1">...that class &ndash; I go ahead and do this, </span><span class="c4 c1">display:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">flex;</span><span class="c1">. Now that&#39;s not enough because the thing is that we need to make sure this is going to work with the...most of the popular browsers and we need to take into account the WebKit browsers. So now the WebKit engine is used by popular browsers, like Safari and Chrome, so we also need to add this line </span><span class="c4 c1">-webkit-flex;</span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;and that&#39;ll ensure that it&#39;ll run not just in Internet Explorer and say, Opera, but it will run in the WebKit browsers.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c23">flexbox1.html</span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 326.00px; height: 338.00px;"><img alt="" src="images_rwd/image11.png" style="width: 326.00px; height: 338.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 327.00px; height: 336.20px;"><img alt="" src="images_rwd/image4.png" style="width: 327.00px; height: 349.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now if I go ahead and save that &ndash; Ctrl+S and F12 to run it &ndash; you can see, right off the bat, the effect here. Now the effect is great. What we&#39;ve done is manage to vertically center that div and that was something that &ndash; if you&#39;ve done any web design, you know that vertically centering divs is not always the...the most fun activity. It can be difficult to do, it can have unpredictable results. But with WebKit, the very first benefit to that is that we can actually &ndash; by changing that parent container &ndash; center that div vertically inside it. Now if I go ahead and just move this around, you can see that it&#39;s going to...both are going to flex and the reason they flex is only because I haven&#39;t given the fixed width to the </span><span class="c4 c1">container</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;class and I&#39;ve set 50% width and height to the </span><span class="c4 c1">centered</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;class. So there&#39;s nothing to it, the flex isn&#39;t really showing us what we can do with it beyond the actual vertical centering, but if we take a look at this page &ndash; now I&#39;ve got a master div...an outside container and inside, I&#39;ve got four smaller child div containers. And the very first one here is called </span><span class="c4 c1">initial</span><span class="c1">. And then </span><span class="c4 c1">none</span><span class="c1">, the second one that says, </span><span class="c4 c1">Always</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">100px</span><span class="c1">. And then </span><span class="c4 c1">flex1</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and that says, </span><span class="c4 c1">1/3</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">of</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">the</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">remaining</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">width</span><span class="c1">. And then </span><span class="c4 c1">flex2</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and that&#39;s the one that says, </span><span class="c4 c1">2/3</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">of</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">the</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">remaining</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">width</span><span class="c1">. Now if I run it right now, okay, nothing is really showing us anything here because I haven&#39;t added that flex property to the parent container yet. But if I go ahead and shrink the width, you can see that these two, the two bottom divs, are actually shrinking. But as I go beyond this top div here, the one that says, </span><span class="c4 c1">500px</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">when</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">there</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">is</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">room</span><span class="c1">, okay, that one&#39;s actually not shrinking. And this one here is always going to stay at a 100 pixels. Now I&#39;ll show you what that means. I&#39;ll go back here and with our parent container, that contains all the other divs, I&#39;m going to add the FlexBox property. And again remember, we need to add the </span><span class="c4 c1">-webkit-flex</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;just to make sure it works...oops, </span><span class="c4 c1">-webkit-flex;</span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;works with WebKit browsers, go ahead and save that, bring this back up. Then we&#39;re going to maximize it, and refresh our page to reload it. And suddenly, we can see now what&#39;s happened here. </span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0 c31">flexbox2.html</span></p><p class="c9 c10"><span class="c1">without </span><span class="c17">display</span><span class="c1 c33">:</span><span class="c33 c37">flex</span><span class="c33 c1 c34">;</span></p><p class="c9 c28"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 609.00px; height: 130.00px;"><img alt="" src="images_rwd/image12.png" style="width: 609.00px; height: 130.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c10 c9"><span class="c1">with </span><span class="c17">display</span><span class="c33 c1">:</span><span class="c33 c37">flex</span><span class="c34 c33 c1">;</span></p><p class="c29 c9"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 633.00px; height: 62.00px;"><img alt="" src="images_rwd/image9.png" style="width: 633.00px; height: 62.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c9 c29"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 372.00px; height: 58.00px;"><img alt="" src="images_rwd/image7.png" style="width: 372.00px; height: 58.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c29 c9"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 272.00px; height: 58.00px;"><img alt="" src="images_rwd/image10.png" style="width: 272.00px; height: 58.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c29 c9"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 220.00px; height: 48.00px;"><img alt="" src="images_rwd/image3.png" style="width: 220.00px; height: 48.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Okay, we&#39;ve got everything set and nicely one next to the other &ndash; that&#39;s the first obvious benefit. We didn&#39;t have to use the </span><span class="c4 c1">float</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;property here, we&#39;ve actually done it using the </span><span class="c4 c1">flex</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;property for </span><span class="c4 c1">display</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;or the </span><span class="c4 c1">display</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;property using the </span><span class="c4 c1">flex</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;attribute and that&#39;s great. But the other benefit to this and this is where FlexBox really shines &ndash; I&#39;ll go ahead and minimize that screen &ndash; and then start to change the size. And you see as I do, what&#39;s happening here is that this one is always going to be 500 pixels when there&#39;s room but it will shrink to 200 pixels if there&#39;s not room, okay, but it won&#39;t go any smaller than 200-pixels wide. This one&#39;s always going to be 100 pixels &ndash; and I&#39;ll show you the code in a second to explain how this is working. This one is always going to be one-third of whatever width is left over after these two have been accounted for and this&#39;ll take </span><span class="c4 c1">2/3</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">of</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">the</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">remaining</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">width</span><span class="c1">. So as I shrink this down, you can see these two are always going to be one-third and two-thirds of the remaining width, this will always be 100 pixels, and this will always be 500 pixels until we actually get so small &ndash; and you watch, I&#39;ll just shrink it down there and then at some point, there it goes, okay, so it&#39;s starting to shrink now to 200 pixels. It will shrink to 200 but then no smaller. So that...there&#39;s 200 pixels right there and then as I increase the width, you can see that is increasing...increasing until its 500 and then it will stay at 500. Now what&#39;s happening with our CSS? Well, it&#39;s really simple, okay? So we&#39;ve used that master container to set our </span><span class="c4 c1">flex</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;property or </span><span class="c4 c1">display</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;property with </span><span class="c4 c1">flex</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;on it. And here what we&#39;ve done is, we&#39;ve set up our </span><span class="c4 c1">initial</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&ndash; that&#39;s this one &ndash; so that class </span><span class="c4 c1">initial</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;right there is going to use </span><span class="c4 c1">flex:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">initial; </span><span class="c1">and </span><span class="c4 c1">-webkit-flex</span><span class="c1">. Again remember, we have to use WebKit for certain browsers and we&#39;re going to set that at being </span><span class="c4 c1">initial</span><span class="c1">. And what we&#39;re saying there is...we&#39;re saying the initial size, okay, so the initial size is going to be </span><span class="c4 c1">500px</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;but then we&#39;re &ndash; using the </span><span class="c4 c1">width</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;property...but then we&#39;ve used the </span><span class="c4 c1">min-width</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;property, </span><span class="c4 c1">min-width</span><span class="c1">, and set it at 200. And so by using the </span><span class="c4 c1">flex</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;property and then setting that width at 500, that&#39;ll set it at 500 until we get to a point where we need to shrink it down and that&#39;s at </span><span class="c4 c1">200px</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&ndash; and it&#39;ll always shrink to 200. And remember, as we shrunk that window down vertically...or horizontally rather, that it shrunk down to 200 pixels. So that&#39;s the first one. Now </span><span class="c4 c1">none</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is pretty simple. We&#39;re just saying </span><span class="c4 c1">flex:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">none;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and we&#39;re setting the width at a 100 pixels so that&#39;s just a fixed value, it&#39;ll always stay at 100 pixels. But then we get to </span><span class="c4 c1">flex1</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c4 c1">flex2</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and that&#39;s one-third and two-thirds. And here what we&#39;re doing is using the </span><span class="c4 c1">-webkit-flex</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c4 c1">flex</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;property and setting a value of </span><span class="c4 c1">1</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and that value means one-third, okay? So by setting it at </span><span class="c4 c1">1</span><span class="c1">, we&#39;re saying it&#39;s always going to be one-third relative to this value here, which is two-thirds, okay? So what we&#39;re saying here is that this one&#39;s always going to be one-third because we used the </span><span class="c4 c1">1</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;property or the </span><span class="c4 c1">1</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;value for that </span><span class="c4 c1">flex</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;property and then </span><span class="c4 c1">2</span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;here and that will be the two-thirds.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c1">So FlexBox is extremely powerful because what it starts to allow you to do is not just center those divs vertically and have them sit side by side but also to allow you to set the values of...of a div container and then determine at what point that&#39;s going to shrink or change size, depending on the viewport width. And that&#39;s really invaluable when...not just when we&#39;re designing for small devices like smartphones and tablets but also when we&#39;re designing for regular websites, where even on a desktop somebody might not have that...that website at full screen and we can use that FlexBox container to actually change the size according to how we want our website to appear on the screen.</span></p><h2 class="c8 c6" id="h.c934vw9d6qka"><span>T</span><span class="c16">he CSS3 Grid Layout As a Flexible Container</span></h2><p class="c19 c9"><span class="c3 c24">Learning Objective</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">After completing this topic, you should be able to</span></p><ul class="c7 lst-kix_40o07afeo36z-0 start"><li class="c20 c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1">describe how to implement the CSS3 grid layout with flexible lengths (fraction units)</span></li></ul><h3 class="c22 c6" id="h.gdtlmbpxp4gd"><span class="c11">Implementing the CSS3 grid layout</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In this video, I&#39;ll discuss using the CSS3 grid layout as a flexible container. Okay, so I&#39;ve got a layout here and as you can see on the right-hand side, I&#39;ve got some div containers and they&#39;ve got some numbers inside them: </span><span class="c4 c1">2</span><span class="c1">, </span><span class="c4 c1">3</span><span class="c1">, </span><span class="c4 c1">4</span><span class="c1">, </span><span class="c4 c1">5</span><span class="c1">. So let&#39;s go down and take a look at the HTML first. Now in the HTML, what I have here is a wrapper to start with and that&#39;s the gray dotted box around all the divs. And then I&#39;ve got </span><span class="c4 c1">2</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">columns</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;layout so here I&#39;ve got two columns. Here I&#39;ve got a three-column layout and you can see right there. By the way, these are all bound by a container...a class called </span><span class="c4 c1">container</span><span class="c1">. I&#39;ve got my </span><span class="c4 c1">4</span><span class="c1">s and the </span><span class="c4 c1">4</span><span class="c1">s are four columns. And then finally, I have my </span><span class="c4 c1">5</span><span class="c1">s. There they are. So there are five </span><span class="c4 c1">5</span><span class="c1">s, four </span><span class="c4 c1">4</span><span class="c1">s, three </span><span class="c4 c1">3</span><span class="c1">s, two </span><span class="c4 c1">2</span><span class="c1">s, and you get the idea. Let&#39;s go back up to the CSS now. Because the wrapper is pretty straightforward at </span><span class="c4 c1">75%</span><span class="c1">, we&#39;ve got that dashed line around it just so we can see it, and here we&#39;ve got our class </span><span class="c4 c1">container</span><span class="c1">. Now remember, each of these...these two </span><span class="c4 c1">2</span><span class="c1">s are contained within that container. Down here, these three </span><span class="c4 c1">3</span><span class="c1">s are all contained within the class </span><span class="c4 c1">container</span><span class="c1">. So the first thing I want to do is use the flexbox to modify that </span><span class="c4 c1">container</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;class. So I&#39;ll go ahead and just add a line here </span><span class="c4 c1">display:flex;</span><span class="c1">. And we have to also add </span><span class="c4 c1">display:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">webkit</span><span class="c1">...</span><span class="c4 c1">-webkit-flex;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to make sure that we capture browsers, like Safari and Chrome, which use the WebKit engine. Now if I go ahead and save that right now &ndash; </span><span class="c0">Ctrl+S</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to save &ndash; and then just launch it in the browser. Okay, so now we can see right off the bat that something&#39;s happened here. Not very spectacular but the idea is we now change this </span><span class="c4 c1">container</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;class to be the...the flexbox, and now we can go ahead and start to modify the CSS for our various containers. Now...our various columns rather &ndash; so we have columns set up, these classes </span><span class="c4 c1">1-2</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and that means one-half, </span><span class="c4 c1">1-3</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is one-third, </span><span class="c4 c1">1-4</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;one quarter, and so on. And so what we want to do now is start setting our widths. And because we set this is as a flexbox &ndash; now if we set the width of the one-half container and one-half, of course, is </span><span class="c4 c1">50%</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&ndash; do the same thing with this one, so </span><span class="c4 c1">width:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">33%</span><span class="c3 c1">, one quarter, and one-fifth.</span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 513.00px; height: 114.00px;"><img alt="" src="images_rwd/image2.png" style="width: 513.00px; height: 114.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Make sure I put in my semicolons there, it&#39;s very important with CSS. That one looks good, okay. So go ahead and save that. Bring our browser window back up, make it full screen, and refresh the page to reflect or to reload those changes that we made. And now you can see suddenly what&#39;s happened here. So remember, we set the </span><span class="c4 c1">1-2</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;at </span><span class="c4 c1">50%</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;for one-half, </span><span class="c4 c1">1-3</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;at </span><span class="c4 c1">33%</span><span class="c3 c1">, and so on. And in responsive web design, the flexbox with CSS3 allows us to do this in a really elegant way. So now if I go ahead and shrink down that window size, you see that as I go ahead and just resize the width of the window, that those columns are going to continue to be one-half, one-third, one-quarter, and one-fifth of the width of that master container...that wrapper, and we do all this using the flexbox property and using a little bit of very simple math actually. And this is the beautiful thing about a grid layout in responsive web design where you can start to layout these grids, create them, and then you&#39;ve got all sorts of possibilities in terms of how you design your website and make responsive for whatever device is actually loading that website.</span></p><h2 class="c8 c6" id="h.gohenzgcplc5"><span class="c16">Semantic Grid Systems</span></h2><p class="c19 c9"><span class="c3 c24">Learning Objective</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">After completing this topic, you should be able to</span></p><ul class="c7 lst-kix_aghc4m5spamw-0 start"><li class="c20 c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1">describe how to implement semantic grid systems using a preprocessor such as SASS</span></li></ul><h3 class="c22 c6" id="h.8efozwmsclqg"><span class="c11">Implementing semantic grid systems</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c1">In this video, I&#39;ll discuss Semantic Grid Systems. Before I can talk about Semantic Grid Systems, I need to discuss CSS Preprocessors. So what are they? Well, first, CSS Preprocessor are an alternative, a very powerful one to traditional CSS. Preprocessors are enhanced CSS scripts that get compiled or preprocessed into CSS. In essence, Preprocessed CSS is a super powerful CSS that offers enhanced functionality over regular CSS. CSS Preprocessors allow you to use programming language like features, like variables, functions and so on, you can nest CSS, which means instead of repeating selectors many times, which is a necessary evil of working with regular CSS that can make your code quite long and difficult to read. You simply nest the rules that should be applied to child elements. You can import external files very useful for splitting up your CSS and creating a more manageable rule set. But this is done using the at import rule, a standard CSS rule that allows you to import style rules from other style sheets, but unlike standard CSS, which creates new HTTP request every time you use at import, SASS for example, a popular CSS Preprocessor will combine the files you want to import and serve a single CSS file in the browser. So it&#39;s very efficient.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Preprocessors also extend CSS, meaning that you can share CSS properties between selectors. And then we have mixins, which let you make groups of CSS declarations that you plan on reusing throughout your site. These last two features especially support and promote the dry rule, don&#39;t repeat yourself. If you&#39;ve done any serious work with CSS you know how important that is. There is several popular CSS Preprocessor, so we have a choice to make when you decide to use preprocessing. You will always hear </span><span class="c42"><a class="c25" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sass-lang.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1621689757946000&amp;usg=AOvVaw263PMd6hkkvf5U7dxoNVNp">SASS</a></span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;mentioned in the discussion as it tends to be the first one you&#39;ll hear about, but there is also Stylus, LESS, CSS-Crush, Myth and Rework among many others. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses and before you dive into preprocessing, you should understand the features and capabilities so you can choose the one that&#39;s right for you. SASS, short for Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets is the most popular CSS Preprocessor. So I&#39;ll use this in example on what you need in order to work with it. First, you need to install Ruby so you can compile the code you create. And you don&#39;t need to be terribly familiar with Ruby. So don&#39;t let that scare you off. There is a single click Ruby installer available for windows, and if you&#39;re using OS 10 Ruby comes preinstalled. You compile style sheets using a command line, so you do need to become familiar with the necessary commands to do this. And you can use SaaS applications to watch files for changes and recompile them automatically.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c1">And there are several applications that will get you up and running with SaaS in a few minutes, some are paid apps and some are open-source. So you have choice and again just familiarize yourself with these apps before choosing. For example, Codekit and Compass are both paid apps, but they are not expensive at all. Koala is an open-source app and there are others like Hammer, LiveReload, Scout and so on. Many of these were design to work with and compile CSS from multiple Preprocessors. So you&#39;re not limited to SaaS when working with these applications. Finally, what do I mean when I say Semantic Grid System? Well, Semantic Grids are page layouts that use a Preprocessor system like Sass. They are cross browser compatible, so you don&#39;t have to worry about compatibility issues as long as the browser supports standard HTML5 and CSS3. In Semantic Grids, you set your columns, rows, gutters, and other standardized layer components and these comprise your Grid System where all the content of your page is formatted and displayed. Semantic Grids are created using a combination of Preprocessor code, things like variables, loops, mixins, functions, and so on. Again, the code and the process may differ depending on which Preprocessor you use, but once it&#39;s compiled, the code is served up to a browser and you have your Semantic Grid layout, nice and neat and ready to reformat the page as a browser viewport size changes.</span></p><h2 class="c8 c6" id="h.o2nbpi8y2pyj"><span class="c16">Measurements for Responsiveness</span></h2><h3 class="c19 c9" id="h.xxyalzvz5j2n"><span class="c12 c1">Learning Objective</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">After completing this topic, you should be able to</span></p><ul class="c7 lst-kix_w31k3tdi3gm0-0 start"><li class="c20 c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1">describe and contrast use of percentages, ems, rems, and viewport units in responsive design</span></li></ul><h3 class="c22 c6" id="h.3hpgxnj5ovti"><span class="c11">Exploring units in responsive design</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c1">When designing for Responsiveness it&#39;s all about the measurements. It&#39;s important to understand the various measurement options and when to use them. And in this video I&#39;ll explain measurements for Responsiveness. If you&#39;re familiar with web design at all, you&#39;re also familiar with the various types of measurements that you can use. Measurements apply to pretty much any object on a web page, so it could be some text, div, a table, an image or a video and how we define the dimensions of objects will greatly impact the look of a website. The first lesson that web designers usually learn as they get into setting up a web page structure is how to pay attention to measurements. I am willing to bet, there are lot of first-time designers probably put in fixed width spaced on full screen browser windows and their own native screen resolutions. And while it looked great on the native system in this intended view, it didn&#39;t work out so well when the browser was resized or the site was loaded on a system with different specs. It&#39;s a good lesson that every web designer has to learn. Percentages are pretty straight forward. We use percentages to create an elastic effect. That is as the window dimensions change, the dimensions continue to be a percentage of the view. So a setting of 50% will always be 50% relative to the window size. Em units are relative to their parent container and their benefits to this. For example, nested lists will decrease in font size at each step down in the hierarchy. And each new child in the nested list.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But it can be difficult to determine font sizes on complex pages and there can be plenty of trial and error when using Ems. Rem units are similar to em except that they are relative to the root element rather than the parent. For example, changing the </span><span class="c33 c44">li</span><span class="c1">, the list item selector to </span><span class="c33 c37">0.75 rem</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;will ensure all nested list items remain at 12 pixels. Rems may not be available for use in all browsers, but currently rems are available in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera and IE9 and higher. So if you decide to use </span><span class="c33 c37">rem</span><span class="c3 c1">, you&#39;ll have to create some kind of work-around to accommodate other browsers. CSS3 also includes new viewport units; four properties called vw, vh, vmin and vmax. These new properties allow you to scale font sizes according to the viewport dimensions. For example, 1vw is 1% of the viewport width; 1vh is 1% of the viewport height, 1vmin is the smallest value taken from 1vw or 1vh; and 1vmax will take the largest value from either 1vw or 1vh.</span></p><h2 class="c6 c8" id="h.awi8j6cuikw8"><span class="c16">Rounding Issues</span></h2><h3 class="c19 c9" id="h.8ap8ifyzxv59"><span class="c12 c1">Learning Objective</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">After completing this topic, you should be able to</span></p><ul class="c7 lst-kix_kdeiqa3akpmf-0 start"><li class="c20 c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1">describe the issue of rounding</span></li></ul><h3 class="c13 c9" id="h.d0vmbtfix2do"><span class="c18">1. Describing rounding issues</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In this video, I&#39;ll discuss rounding issues. Responsive web design is simply a fluid grid &ndash; that is fluid images and media queries. But fluid grids have a nasty drawback: rounding errors. Because we want to use percentages to layout our grids, we&#39;re faced with the harsh reality of uneven values. What I mean by that is that even percentages, like 50 or 25%, are pretty straightforward but what happens when we start getting into thirds and other odd measurements that don&#39;t neatly result in an integer when they&#39;re divided. Well, we have to use places after the decimal and the question becomes how many places and what&#39;s the impact? In this example, things are pretty neat because everything is even. I&#39;ll go ahead and show you. Okay, that looks pretty good. Remember, everything is divided nicely into 100% using </span><span class="c4 c1">2</span><span class="c1">, </span><span class="c4 c1">4</span><span class="c1">, and </span><span class="c4 c1">5</span><span class="c1">. But what if I needed six columns or a column that was one-third or two-thirds of the width of my layout? Let&#39;s put these in and see what we...what we get. Now I&#39;ve already got CSS rules for this and we&#39;ll take a look in a second. But just to sort of expedite this, I&#39;ll start by taking say, </span><span class="c4 c1">4</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">columns</span><span class="c1">, and </span><span class="c0">Copy</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;it. Put it right here because we&#39;re going to create three columns now. </span><span class="c0">Paste</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;that in and just change this to </span><span class="c4 c1">3</span><span class="c1">. And remember, I&#39;ve got a rule for that so I&#39;ll just go ahead and change that to 1,3...</span><span class="c4 c1">1-3</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;for one-third and change these to 3s. Okay, let&#39;s go ahead and </span><span class="c0">Copy</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;this one, </span><span class="c0">Paste</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;it in, and this will be our </span><span class="c4 c1">6</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">columns</span><span class="c1">. And again, I&#39;ve got a rule called </span><span class="c4 c1">1-6</span><span class="c1">, </span><span class="c4 c1">column1-6</span><span class="c1">. And this is a class so we can actually reuse it, I&#39;ll change these to 6s just so it looks right when we load it into the browser. Okay, and because we&#39;re using six columns, I&#39;ll go ahead and just </span><span class="c0">Copy</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;this and </span><span class="c0">Paste</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;it here. We&#39;re going to add a sixth div container, and then go ahead and save that. Go back to our webpage and let&#39;s refresh it to see what happened. Alright, so here we can see our thirds and 6s. The thirds are right there and the 6s are right there. And you can see that they look okay, they look fine. There&#39;s nothing too obvious here. Now let&#39;s take a look at the CSS rules. If I move up to our one-thirds, you can see that the value here...the width is set to 33% with eight points after the decimal and that&#39;s fairly granular. Same with the 6s, which are 16% with six...with eight places after the decimal and using 6s, and then I&#39;ve rounded it off to 7 at the end because that&#39;s what you would normally do when it&#39;s representing one-sixth as a percentage. But I&#39;ve also got a rule here &ndash; let&#39;s go ahead and take a look &ndash; for two-thirds and note that it also uses eight points after the decimal along with that final seven at the end. Now let&#39;s add a set of divs to the end of my document, and I&#39;ll go ahead and just </span><span class="c0">Copy</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;this one, and </span><span class="c0">Paste</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;it in, and I&#39;ll change this to </span><span class="c4 c1">Mixed</span><span class="c3 c1">. Now remember, we only need two here. We need one-third and that other rule is called two-thirds. Go ahead and get rid of these other divs. Change the text inside so we can see what&#39;s happening. Oops! Okay, go ahead and save that, bring our page back up, and refresh.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c1">Okay, now something doesn&#39;t look right here. If you compare the columns, the 6s above this row...the first two sets of 6s should line up with the one-third below. I&#39;ll zoom in so it&#39;s more obvious. Okay, you can see the discrepancy right there. Now this is why percentage can be tricky. Remember, the browser is responsible for translating these values to fit the viewport and all the common browsers are culprits when it comes to doing this because the browser engine has to translate these values into pixels and there&#39;s no spec that states how to do this so each browser vendor is free to make their own rules. And you have to think about it this way. If a browser needed to fix six columns into 1000 pixels, the result would be 166.66666 and so on and the browser could round up to 167 but 167 x 6 is 1002 so you&#39;d have two extra pixels that the browser can&#39;t contend with. If the browser rounds down to 166 pixels per column, the result would be 6 x 166 which is 996-pixels wide and there would be four extra pixels, and the browser still couldn&#39;t accurately fit those columns. Let me just zoom back out here, make it &ndash; there, that looks pretty good.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c1">Okay, so what&#39;s the answer? Well, as long as you&#39;re using percentages, there&#39;s not much you can do except keep an eye on it and use workarounds. There&#39;s also adaptive web design, which is very effective in addressing this particular kind of issue but we&#39;re not talking about adaptive web design. So how to deal with this? Well, some browsers have already implemented something called subpixel rendering, which calculates all the values and tries to adapt the elements. We could wait for all the browsers to implement some kind of fix but experience tells us that it&#39;s not practical to think that way. Flexbox won&#39;t fix the issue because it&#39;s susceptible to the same issues when using percentages. The best approach right now is a common sense approach. Watch your values and don&#39;t let the rounding problems add up and compound themselves. When possible, you can try to avoid those percentages, which isn&#39;t practical either because thirds and their multiples tend to be very popular in web layout. And you can also cheat, add that one pixel or percentage point to fix the error. Again, not very practical. The best advice I can give is to pay attention to potential errors, don&#39;t allow them to compound, and keep your eyes on browser technology and new techniques for responsive design, which are appearing all the time.</span></p><h2 class="c8 c6" id="h.eohmufk008sk"><span class="c16">Text and Responsive Web Design</span></h2><h3 class="c19 c9" id="h.z0punf3i0f7j"><span class="c12 c1">Learning Objective</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">After completing this topic, you should be able to</span></p><ul class="c7 lst-kix_7da4hu4i5tud-0 start"><li class="c20 c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1">configure flexible text with appropriate measurement units for size and line height and features such as text overflow in a responsive web design solution</span></li></ul><h3 class="c22 c6" id="h.ur8csxq35wnm"><span class="c11">Exploring web design features</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Responsive web design considers every element and asset on a web page including text. Remember, websites need to be legible as well as attractive. In this video, I&#39;ll discuss text and how it plays into responsive web design. In this video, I&#39;ll discuss text and responsive design. I&#39;ve got a document here and I am using a </span><span class="c4 c1">class</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;called </span><span class="c4 c1">&quot;column1-3&quot;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to represent one-third. And then just use three of those divs inside a </span><span class="c4 c1">&quot;container&quot;</span><span class="c1">, right there, and that&#39;s also a </span><span class="c4 c1">class</span><span class="c1">. And if I bring it up in our web page, there it is. Now the thing is as I resize the width of this, you&#39;ll see that the height changes as does the width of these columns. And the text, sort of, flows down and fits, which is pretty much what you&#39;d expect the way I&#39;ve got this laid out. Because up here, I&#39;ve set up a </span><span class="c4 c1">flex</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;container, okay, a FlexBox for that main </span><span class="c4 c1">.container</span><span class="c1">. And so everything runs side by side. And then it&#39;s just going to fit automatically because down here, in that </span><span class="c4 c1">.column1-3</span><span class="c1">, I&#39;ve got a </span><span class="c4 c1">width</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;of 33%. Okay, so nothing spectacular at this point. But here is the thing; we have </span><span class="c4 c1">vw</span><span class="c1">, </span><span class="c4 c1">vh</span><span class="c1">, and </span><span class="c4 c1">vmin</span><span class="c3 c1">. And you notice, by the way, that as I resize this box, the font size doesn&#39;t change at all.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So we have </span><span class="c4 c1">vw</span><span class="c1">, </span><span class="c4 c1">vh</span><span class="c1">, and </span><span class="c4 c1">vmin</span><span class="c1">. And these new properties allow you to scale font size according to the viewport dimensions. Now it&#39;s fairly uncomplicated. A </span><span class="c4 c1">vw</span><span class="c1">, which is for width, is 1% of the viewport width, one </span><span class="c4 c1">vh</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is 1% of the viewport height, and one </span><span class="c4 c1">vmin</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is the smallest of one </span><span class="c4 c1">vw</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and one </span><span class="c4 c1">vh</span><span class="c1">. So it will take whichever of the two values is smaller. And we can also use places after the decimal. So we are not constrained to actually just using integers. So for example, if I added this...let me go ahead and add a line here. And I am going to add </span><span class="c4 c1">font-size:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and make that </span><span class="c4 c1">2vw</span><span class="c1">. Go ahead and save that, and reload our page. You can see the font size has automatically changed. And remember, </span><span class="c4 c1">vw</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is the viewport width, and I set the value at </span><span class="c4 c1">2</span><span class="c1">. So that will be 2% of the viewport width. Now as I resize this, what&#39;s actually happening here is the font size is changing as well. So that&#39;s really very slick. It&#39;s a really wonderful way of being able to set up your responsive design using that value. And I&#39;ll just go ahead and show you </span><span class="c4 c1">vh</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;as well. So I&#39;ll go ahead and change that to </span><span class="c4 c1">2vh</span><span class="c1">, save it, </span><span class="c0">Refresh</span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;our page.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Okay. And now it&#39;s become really small. Now remember, again, </span><span class="c4 c1">vh</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is the height. Okay, so you may have to tweak that value of 2, or you will have to because obviously that&#39;s way too small to read, but that just gives you an idea of how that works. And remember that if we use </span><span class="c4 c1">vmin</span><span class="c1">...I&#39;ll change that to </span><span class="c4 c1">vmin</span><span class="c1">, save it, reload our page. Okay, it&#39;s going to be 2% of whichever is smaller, the viewport height or the viewport width. And again, not very effective there. We may have to tweak this value. So for instance, if I used </span><span class="c4 c1">5vmin</span><span class="c1">, save that, and </span><span class="c0">Refresh</span><span class="c1">, it&#39;s probably going to be really big. Yeah, it is. Okay, but it&#39;s going to choose...it&#39;s going to change the size of that text based on the lower value or the smallest value between </span><span class="c4 c1">vw</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c4 c1">vh</span><span class="c3 c1">. So you can use those when you&#39;re working on your responsive web designs, it&#39;s really useful. Now I would be a little remiss if I didn&#39;t show you something else here because the layout that I&#39;ve chosen here is a little disingenuous. Here I have got three columns and this is the way you would normally set it up in the olden days, with three columns using three divs side by side. Now that really doesn&#39;t need to happen anymore because if I go ahead and get rid of these tags...I&#39;ll go ahead and get rid of that one, get rid of that one.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So now we have one big column, or one big piece of text rather, and one </span><span class="c4 c1">div</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;inside that </span><span class="c4 c1">div</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">&quot;container&quot;</span><span class="c1">. It&#39;s still called </span><span class="c4 c1">&quot;column1-3&quot;</span><span class="c1">. And if I go ahead and save that and </span><span class="c0">Refresh</span><span class="c1">. Okay, nothing really to see here at this point. But what I am going to do is go back here because this is another beautiful thing about CSS3 and HTML5 that I can use a new property. And this is an important part too of responsive web design because remember, you can&#39;t just think about your width and height. You have to think about what&#39;s going to happen to your text, you know, if you have those three columns, and how the text flows as we&#39;re resizing it. So this is actually a better way of doing it using the CSS3 </span><span class="c4 c1">columns</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;property. I&#39;ll set </span><span class="c4 c1">3</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">columns</span><span class="c1">. And you have to do this as well, </span><span class="c4 c1">-webkit-columns:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">3;</span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;because it&#39;s not enough just to do it for browsers like Internet Explorer. You have to cover the WebKit browsers, and those typically are things like Chrome, Safari, and other popular browsers use WebKit. So you have to put both of those lines in, in order to make sure this covers the various browsers. I&#39;ll go ahead and save this now.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And remember, again, we have gotten rid of the three divs. And we&#39;ve only just got one big </span><span class="c4 c1">div</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;in there with the text inside it. If I go back to our page and </span><span class="c0">Refresh</span><span class="c1">, okay. Now not exactly what we&#39;re looking for. Okay, and there is a reason for that. I have to go back here, and I am just going to get rid of this guy right here, </span><span class="c4 c1">width:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">33%</span><span class="c1">. I am going to take that line out altogether because now I don&#39;t need to set that value anymore, because we had to set it at a third before, because we had three columns...three </span><span class="c4 c1">div</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;containers. Now we don&#39;t. We just have one </span><span class="c4 c1">div</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;container. And so we don&#39;t need to set that. So I&#39;ve saved that. I&#39;ll go back and </span><span class="c0">Refresh</span><span class="c1">. Oops! And there are three columns. Now again, you can go ahead and start to resize that. And you are going to have a really nice effect here with the font size resizing. Now I probably want to go back here and just make sure that I change that value here to probably something like </span><span class="c4 c1">2</span><span class="c1">...I&#39;ll say </span><span class="c4 c1">2.2vmin</span><span class="c1">, or actually, </span><span class="c4 c1">2.2vw</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;for height or width rather. Go ahead and </span><span class="c0">Refresh</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;that. Okay, that&#39;s not too bad. So now if I go ahead and start to resize the width, you can see that the columns are resizing really nicely. The font size is resizing as we change that viewport width using those values of </span><span class="c4 c1">vw</span><span class="c1">, </span><span class="c4 c1">vh</span><span class="c1">, and </span><span class="c4 c1">vmin</span><span class="c1">. And remember, if you are not using the </span><span class="c4 c1">columns</span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;attribute in CSS3 yet, definitely get acquainted with it because it&#39;s really going to help in your responsive web design.</span></p><h2 class="c8 c6" id="h.ogrslnkxxqxu"><span class="c16">Flexible Images</span></h2><h3 class="c19 c9" id="h.aet0nradi4u3"><span class="c12 c1">Learning Objective</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">After completing this topic, you should be able to</span></p><ul class="c7 lst-kix_rvuegwaa9nvi-0 start"><li class="c20 c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1 c35">use the </span><span class="c33 c43">max-width</span><span class="c5 c1">&nbsp;attribute to configure images to be responsive</span></li></ul><h3 class="c22 c6" id="h.y7ww92vvz22"><span class="c11">Configuring flexible responsive images</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In this video, I&#39;ll discuss flexible images. So I have three </span><span class="c4 c1">div</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;containers and they are laid out side by side, you can&#39;t really see that here. But what I want to do is put some images in here. And I&#39;ll go ahead and start by inserting an image. And third container, </span><span class="c0">Insert</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">-</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Image</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">-</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Image</span><span class="c1">. Now obviously what&#39;s happened here, it has become a mess. I&#39;ll go ahead and save that actually. Let&#39;s just preview it in the browser. Yeah, okay. So not really much to look at this point. Now the reason for that obviously...we&#39;ll go ahead and make that full </span><span class="c0">Code</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;window...is that what&#39;s happened is the Dreamweaver, like any good web design application, has just detected the </span><span class="c4 c1">width</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c4 c1">height</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;of these various images and set them right here. And you can see the very, very high widths and heights. And it&#39;s not just going to work for us. Now the thing is in the old days...in the good old days, we would have to tweak these somehow and go ahead and say maybe use a calculator to figure out the </span><span class="c4 c1">width</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c4 c1">height</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;that would fit my containers for the window size...for that viewport size. But that&#39;s not really a very elegant solution because it&#39;s only going to set it to a fixed </span><span class="c4 c1">width</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;or </span><span class="c4 c1">height</span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;if we use pixels. What I can do though -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">[The Adobe Dreamweaver application is displayed.

So it&#39;s, sort of, compounded the problem. But really, using percentages for images is not the way to go because that&#39;s only going to take into account a percentage of that image&#39;s ultimate resolution. And it&#39;s always going to be a fixed value. What we need to do here is work with flexible images. And in CSS3 and HTML5, there is a brand new way of doing this. I&#39;ll go ahead and just highlight this entire thing because we&#39;re going to get rid of it, and instead enter a </span><span class="c4 c1">style</span><span class="c1">. Now we could do this in a stylesheet. Okay, as a matter of fact, that&#39;s probably what I am going to do. You could do it inline here, but why not just go ahead and add a style up here. So I&#39;ll put in a new style for images, use </span><span class="c4 c1">img</span><span class="c3 c1">, and that will affect all images on the page.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">[The 71097.html tabbed page in the Dreamweaver application window.

That using that value </span><span class="c4 c1">max-width</span><span class="c1">, and setting that, and then enforcing the aspect ratio is going to give you a perfect picture that will fit inside the box every time. Now if I resize this window...and you can see as I change the width of my window that the image size changes too. So it&#39;s really a beautiful and elegant way of performing and displaying these images, and so that they&#39;ll reset their size or change their size according to whatever viewport they are using. And suddenly now whether you&#39;re working with a desktop browser or you&#39;ve got a smartphone browser, that those images are going to fit according to how you want them to look in relation to the rest of your web design. So using that very simple value of </span><span class="c4 c1">max-width</span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;is a great way of implementing flexible images in your responsive design.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">[The Responsive Web Design tabbed page is displayed in the browser window.

I&#39;ll go ahead and save that. Load up our web page. And now, you can see that that image is actually fit to that window, the window size. And if I go ahead and increase the size of my browser window, you can see that the background image is going to scale with it. And that&#39;s exactly what we&#39;re looking for in responsive design; you can scale down, vertically, horizontally. And keep in mind it&#39;s not a perfect solution. Its not going to show the entire image, because remember the image is going to have a certain set of proportions, length and height. And of course, its going to do its best job, the browser is fitting that image. It&#39;s not going to show the entire thing all the time.

I can go ahead and resize that and scroll down and scroll over. And you can see it&#39;s a really, really big image. Now, of course, the way we would fix that is to set the width and height of that image and we could use percentages to make it responsive. That&#39;s certainly one good way to do it.

You want the user to be able to look the entire image if they need to. Now here is where we use the CSS3 overflow property. Now overflow allows you to have content that&#39;s going to flow over the size of a container to actually become scrollable. So it actually fits inside the container and you can scroll through it. And it works with texts as well as images, but I&#39;m going to do it for this image. Now, the first thing I want to do is go ahead and I&#39;ve got an extra closing div tag here, I&#39;ll go ahead and actually leave that there, because what I want to do is create a div inside here, and I&#39;ll just start the opening </span><span class="c4 c1">div</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;tag. I won&#39;t give it a class or anything, because let&#39;s go ahead and create that style first. So up in the style section, what I want to do is create a class called image box, </span><span class="c4 c1">imgbox</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and I&#39;m creating a class, so we can actually apply this to multiple items on the page. And this is very useful when you&#39;re trying to treat or deal with images that when they get to a certain point, they&#39;re so big that you don&#39;t want them overflowing, you want them to actually show up with scroll bars. So let&#39;s start by doing this. I&#39;ll go ahead and create that style and then do this, </span><span class="c4 c1">div</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">class=&quot;imgbox&quot;</span><span class="c3 c1">.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">[The 71099.html tabbed page is displayed in the Dreamweaver application window.

Great. So now, we&#39;ve got that div container called image box, and inside it is our image. And what I want to do is start assigning information here. Now, I&#39;ll start by doing this. I&#39;m going to give it a </span><span class="c4 c1">width</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and a </span><span class="c4 c1">height</span><span class="c1">, because remember we&#39;re not changing the width and height of the image now. We&#39;re changing the width and height of that div container. Make it </span><span class="c4 c1">300</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;x </span><span class="c4 c1">300</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;pixels. And I&#39;ll give it a </span><span class="c4 c1">border</span><span class="c1">. This is of course totally up to you, but I just want to give this a border, give a nice orange border, like that. Now, if I go ahead and save it at this point and then bring up our browser, there is our image. Now, again, it&#39;s still very, very big. You can see that orange border, right there and right there. And this is the size of our box, 300x300, but clearly that image has overflowed that box. We don&#39;t want that to happen. And because we don&#39;t want to resize the image, we do this. And here is the rule that does it all, </span><span class="c4 c1">overflow</span><span class="c1">, and then we choose the </span><span class="c4 c1">scroll</span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;attribute.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">[The 71099.html tabbed page is displayed in the Dreamweaver application window.

And when I load up the webpage, what&#39;s happened now is any overflow outside of that 300x300 pixel box is now going to be treated as overflow content and now instead of seeing and sort of watching it on the rest of screen, we can now scroll through the content using the scroll bars that are created by that overflow property. Now, keep in mind that this works again not just with images, but it also works with text as well. And it&#39;s a great way of treating your content, things like images and again, text; when you&#39;re dealing with a screen size or a viewport that&#39;s gotten so small that you need to be able to somehow have the user access it without it breaking the rest of your web design layout.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">[The 71099.html tabbed page is displayed in the Dreamweaver application window.

Let&#39;s go ahead and take a look at this PNG file, this PNG I created called sprite. And you can see here, we&#39;ve got four distinct images &ndash; one, two, three, four &ndash; in a grid of two by two. And what I want to be able to do here is actually just grab the plane here, okay, and just show that. And then I want to grab the train, and then the boat, and then the cars on the highway. And I want to be able to do that using the sprite. Now the purpose and the benefit of sprites is that you have one single image, where you can actually go and grab stuff. And it makes it far more efficient in terms of server loads going back to the server to grab an image. And it&#39;s also very useful if you want to create animations. But here we&#39;re actually doing this specifically for responsive designs. So we want to say, okay, we&#39;ve got these images, we want to grab them, and then we want to do something with them. Go ahead and close that and close that.

The only reason I&#39;m doing this is because it&#39;s very large and I want to be able to just see it shrunken down a bit so we can take a look at it in the browser. If I go ahead and open the browser now, you can see there&#39;s our sprite image and all four pictures are there. And again what we want to do is just grab each one and display them independently. So I&#39;m going to get rid of this altogether. We don&#39;t really need this. Just go like that. Because in order to do this, we need to use CSS. Now I go up to our style sheet and I&#39;m going to create a new class called </span><span class="c4 c1">sprite</span><span class="c3 c1">. And inside that class, I&#39;m going to start defining things for it. So first off what I want to do is type in the width and we&#39;re going to be using percentages here. So this works great with pixels, but because we&#39;re designing for responsiveness, we&#39;re going to be using just percentages, and that&#39;s really important. Now why 25%? Well it&#39;s a two by two image to create a four and we only want a quarter of that image. So I&#39;m going to say that width is 25%.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">[The Select Image Source dialog box is displayed in the Dreamweaver application window.

He deletes the following code statement on line #25: &lt;img src=&quot;sprite.png&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; height=&quot;50%&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt; He then adds the following code from line #18: 18 .sprite { 19 width: 25%; 20 }]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c1">Padding-bottom. And this is the other important one. Padding-bottom is necessary because this defines where the image gets cut off at the bottom of that sprite. And what we want to do is set it at a value that we can cut off anything that&#39;s not actually part of the image of those four images that we want to grab. And I&#39;m going to set this at 25% again because again we&#39;re talking about a two by two image. The next thing I want to do is set our background image itself. There it is right there. I&#39;ll go ahead and grab that sprite PNG. And again, that&#39;s why I took the image tag out of the div container here because we don&#39;t need it. What we&#39;re going to do is actually set that background image up here in the CSS for this particular class. And then background position; now this is the really important one when you&#39;re dealing with sprites. What this allows you to do is set two values, an x and a y value, and each value determines at what point that image is going to be shown; what portion of that image is going to be shown. So in this case, you could set pixel values. But I don&#39;t want to do that, I want to set percentage values because we&#39;re designing for responsiveness. Now I&#39;m saying 0% and 0%; what that means is that it&#39;s going to be the upper left-hand corner at the very top. So the very top, zero and zero, x and y. And then display block.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">[The 71100.html tabbed page is displayed in the Dreamweaver application window.

And this just allows us to determine how that image is going to be displayed inside the div container. So once we&#39;ve done that then we start adding our divs down here, </span><span class="c4 c1">div</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">class=sprite</span><span class="c1">, close that div container. Now if I go ahead and save this now, and open the browser with F12, you can see there&#39;s a portion of our image. Now something didn&#39;t actually work out too well there and I know what it was. Okay background; I forgot to put in background size, I&#39;ll put that down here. So we need to put in background size because that will actually do the scaling on the image. Remember this width and padding is going to apply to the actual div container, but here&#39;s where we&#39;re actually changing the background size; remember we have a background image &ndash; that&#39;s our sprite. And I&#39;ll set that at 200%, and that will just scale it to 200%. Let&#39;s go ahead and save that, load it up. Okay. Great. So there&#39;s our airplane, and we&#39;ve done all that using those values here. So again remember, we&#39;re grabbing the x and y value here, and then just setting the background size. And that&#39;s just going to grab that particular image, that one quarter of that image. But what if we want to take a look at the rest of them? Well it&#39;s really simple.

I&#39;m going to do this in line so we can override whatever settings we&#39;ve got up in our </span><span class="c4 c1">sprite</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;class definition in the CSS styles, and say </span><span class="c4 c1">style=&quot;background-position&quot;</span><span class="c1">, remember that&#39;s the important one, background position. And remember there are two values, so this I&#39;m going to say is 0% and a 100%. Now why am I doing that? Well remember, one&#39;s an x value and one&#39;s a y value. 0% is going to define the x value, so how far over it&#39;s going. So we&#39;re going to go from the left. But 100% means going down &ndash; y value. And so this should show us the boat image that&#39;s below that airplane image and just that portion, because I&#39;ve used 0% and 100%. Go ahead and save that, press </span><span class="c0">F12</span><span class="c3 c1">. Okay so there&#39;s our boat. Remember the boat is actually underneath. Let&#39;s go back and take a look at that. Yeah, so the boat is right here. So remember, 0%, 0%, 0%, 100%, this should be 100%, 0 and this should be 100%, 100%. And that will grab those images. So let&#39;s go ahead and take a look and see if that&#39;s the case. I&#39;ll just speed things up here by copying this, pasting it in twice.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">[The 71100.html tabbed page is displayed in the Dreamweaver application window.

As a result, the Responsive Web Design tabbed page is displayed in the browser window. As a result, the container now includes the image of the aero plane and the boat placed besides each other. The presenter navigates to the File Explorer that displays the 71100 folder. He double-clicks the sprite PNG image file and the sprite image is displayed in the sprite &ndash; Window Photo Viewer. The image consists of four images. He then closes the sprite - Window Photo Viewer window and navigates to the code editor.]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c1">And here it will be a 100%, 0, so it will be over a 100% and down 0% and that should show us that train. And a 100% and 100% should show us the bottom right-hand corner image, which is the car on a rainy day. So if I go ahead and save that now, and bring up our web page, there we go. See. So that&#39;s how you do it. It&#39;s really quite simple. And, you know, the math is the part that you have to get your head around. I&#39;m going to actually bring that back up again because the point here is that the way that I&#39;ve done this by using percentages; that if I try to shrink this down that everything is going to shrink along with the viewport size. And that&#39;s where the responsiveness comes in, that&#39;s why we use percentages instead of actual pixel values. And that&#39;s the whole point of responsive design. And so by using sprites that way, you can really do a lot. But remember keep in mind the important thing is the math. I&#39;ve got a two by two image, and so therefore, I&#39;m dealing with quarters here. If you&#39;ve got a three by three image, you have to do the math for that, and so on, to get it to a point where you can actually work with those sprites. And that&#39;s an important part of it because when you set up your sprites, you should really pay attention to how they&#39;re set up so that they are easy to manipulate inside your web page.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">[The 71100.html tabbed page is displayed in the Dreamweaver application windows.

SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics and it&#39;s a new feature available in HTML5. And it starts with a tag that, you might have guessed, is called SVG. Now SVG has an opening and closing tag, so everything inside these two tags is going to be our SVG graphic. So for instance, if I wanted to draw a line I would just type in, use a </span><span class="c4 c1">line</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;tag, and then set our values, </span><span class="c4 c1">x1=50</span><span class="c1">, </span><span class="c4 c1">x2=50</span><span class="c1">...</span><span class="c4 c1">x1</span><span class="c1">, </span><span class="c4 c1">y1=50</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c4 c1">50</span><span class="c1">, </span><span class="c4 c1">x2=200</span><span class="c1">, </span><span class="c4 c1">y2=100</span><span class="c1">.

Okay. So there it is, there&#39;s our box and it&#39;s inside that frame. Now the problem is...I shouldn&#39;t have closed that...the problem here is that I used fixed values. And if I go ahead and start to resize this viewport, you can see the problem, okay, that&#39;s not changing. So you can design your SVG graphics, which can be anything from lines, to rectangles, to polygons, and ellipses, and text, and create some really nice images, but the problem is if they don&#39;t scale...and that&#39;s the essence Scalable Vector Graphics...they&#39;re designed to scale to almost any size and still look right, because they&#39;re mathematical. But if you don&#39;t actually set this for responsiveness then it&#39;s going to look great in your desktop browser but it&#39;s not going to look very good on a mobile browser. So let&#39;s go ahead and start to fix this. Now the first thing I want to do here is set this to...let&#39;s say, </span><span class="c4 c1">50%</span><span class="c3 c1">.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">[The 71101.html tabbed page is displayed in the Dreamweaver application window.

Go ahead and save that, load up our browser, and there it is. Now interestingly enough it popped down to the bottom right-hand corner of our box. But if I go ahead and shrink the viewport, you can see that that image is going to shrink with it, or that that rectangle is going to shrink with it. And the reason it didn&#39;t, or it went down to lower right-hand corner, is to center something inside our container, our blue container, we set it at </span><span class="c4 c1">25%</span><span class="c1">, </span><span class="c4 c1">25%</span><span class="c1">. So what we&#39;re doing is saying, we&#39;re going to go over </span><span class="c4 c1">25%</span><span class="c1">, down </span><span class="c4 c1">25%</span><span class="c1">, and then a width of </span><span class="c4 c1">50</span><span class="c1">, and a height of </span><span class="c4 c1">50%</span><span class="c3 c1">, and that&#39;s going to mean, it&#39;s going to...it should center and fit perfectly in the center of our box, both vertically and horizontally, no matter how big we shrink, or small we shrink that window.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">[The 71101.html tabbed page is displayed in the Dreamweaver application window.

And that&#39;s okay because this box, the containing box, isn&#39;t designed to respond that way. But the point is that as long as you set those value as percentages, like I&#39;ve shown here, you&#39;re going to get perfect responsive results every time.

Okay so you&#39;re probably familiar with the HTML5 canvas, but just in case you&#39;re not, I&#39;ll just do a quick run through. We set the canvas by using the canvas tag, then we give it a width and the height here, and I&#39;ve used the CSS style to give it a width and a height. And I&#39;ve assigned a background color so we can see what&#39;s happening to the canvas. Then you create your JavaScript. Now everything relies on this ID that we assign to the canvas. So here we create a variable and then use the </span><span class="c4 c1">myCanvas</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;ID to get that element and store that in the variable called </span><span class="c4 c1">canvas</span><span class="c3 c1">. We set a context and what that does is get the context for the canvas. And in this case we&#39;re saying, okay, it&#39;s a 2d canvas. And that variable context is what we&#39;re going use to create anything inside that canvas. In this case, a fill style and then a rectangle. So there are the dimensions x, y, width and height.

It includes a colored canvas enclosed in a border, with some empty space next to the canvas, and a message box that includes the Allow blocked content button. In the message box, the presenter clicks the Allow blocked content button. As a result, the Responsive Web Design tabbed page reloads and displays a differently colored rectangle within the canvas.]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">okay, there&#39;s our canvas with that grey background and then that green rectangle inside of it. Now the problem with canvas is that it really depends on how you set it in order to have it respond in terms of responsive design. What I mean by that is as I shrink this viewport, okay, nothing happens until I get to the edge of the canvas and then it starts to shrink and everything inside it. Now that doesn&#39;t really help us because we want this to be able to respond whatever size we make the web page. So I&#39;ll go ahead and close this and show you what we do here. Now the very first thing that we need to do is set our percentages. So rather than set a physical, or a fixed width and height, we&#39;re going to set percentages. And I say, make that a 100% wide and a 100% high. Now keep in mind that 100% is relative to the container of the canvas is inside, this one right here called </span><span class="c4 c1">div</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">class</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">=</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&quot;</span><span class="c4 c1">container&quot;</span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;and up here in the CSS rule, you can see that we&#39;re using flex. So this is a FlexBox and that&#39;s important too. So we&#39;re saying we want this canvas inside a FlexBox and we want to be 100% of the width and height. And if I go ahead and save that now, and then load up the page,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">[The Responsive Web Design tabbed page is open in the Internet Explorer browser window and displays a differently colored rectangle within the colored canvas. The presenter reduces the width of the browser window until the edge of the existing empty space area next to the canvas, and no change occurs. However, when the presenter continues to resizes the browser window starting from the edge of the canvas, the size of the canvas and the rectangular box within it then changes accordingly and the canvas and the rectangular box are resized or reduced in width. He then closes the browser window and navigates to the Dreamweaver application window. Next on the 71102.html tabbed page, he modifies the code statement on line #25 as follows: 25 &lt;canvas id=&quot;myCanvas&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%; height: 100%; background-color: &quot;#C3C3C3&quot;&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The presenter then refers to the following code statements one after the other: 24 &lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt; 13 .container { 14 display: -webkit-flex; 15 display: flex; 16 border: 2px solid blue; 17 } He then saves the changes made and runs the file.

But what we want to do is also do a little bit of math here and actually resize the content inside and have it perfectly centered. So I&#39;ll go ahead and close that. And what we do in order to do that is create some new variables. So I&#39;ll create a variable called w for width; so w, h, x, and y = canvas.width. So we&#39;re going to grab the width of the canvas and remember that will change as the viewport changes. And so every time it will be great, because we&#39;re going to grab that canvas width. And then multiply it times 0.75. Remember we want to center everything inside that canvas and so we multiply that with value down to allow for everything on the left and right of whatever objects are inside the canvas. Do the same thing for height; </span><span class="c4 c1">var</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">h=canvas.height*0.75</span><span class="c3 c1">.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">[The Responsive Web Design tabbed page is open in the Internet Explorer browser window and includes the colored canvas covering the entire page, but still enclosed in a border, and the message box containing the Allow blocked content button.

The presenter resizes the browser window and the canvas and the rectangular colored box are resized proportionately along with the browser window. He then closes the Internet Explorer browser window and navigates to the 71102.html tabbed page in the Dreamweaver application window. Next he adds a line space after line #29. Then he enters the following code statements on line #30 and line #31: 30 var w=canvas.width * 0.75; 31 var h=canvas.height * 0.75;]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now we&#39;re going to create a variable called x.

We do this &ndash; </span><span class="c4 c1">canvas.width</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and then we&#39;re going to subtract the w variable that we created up here. And so by subtracting it that&#39;s what gives us the ability...what we&#39;re accounting for...sort of how far over the object is. So we&#39;re doing that math, subtracting that, and then dividing it by 2 to get a perfect center every time. And the same thing for y, </span><span class="c4 c1">(canvas.height-h)/2</span><span class="c1">. Now that we&#39;ve got those variables set, then all we do is for our fill rectangle, we just change these fixed values x, y, w, h. I&#39;ll go ahead and save that. So let&#39;s take a look. I&#39;ll go ahead and press </span><span class="c0">F12</span><span class="c3 c1">.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">[The 71102.html tabbed page is open in the Dreamweaver application window and the presenter enters the following code on line #32 and line #33: 32 var x=(canvas.width - w) / 2; 33 var y=(canvas.height - h) / 2; Then he modifies the code statement on line #34, which is &#39;context.fillRect(50, 0, 200, 100);&#39;, as follows: 34 context.fillRect(x, y, w, h); He then saves the changes made and runs the file by pressing the F12 key.

So all the content that we&#39;ve designed for our canvas...we put on the canvas...is now perfectly centered inside the canvas. And as I change the viewport size, the canvas is resizing and so is the content inside it, and it continues to remain perfectly centered. So that&#39;s an important aspect of working with the canvas in responsive design. It&#39;s important to set percentages for that width and height right here. But keep in mind of the live content that&#39;s inside the canvas, or on the canvas, and make sure that you provide for proper scaling and centering where necessary.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">[The Responsive Web Design tabbed page is open in the Internet Explorer browser window and includes the colored canvas covering the entire page, which is enclosed in a border, with the differently colored rectangular box displayed in the middle of the canvas.

The picture element looks like this &ndash; this is the </span><span class="c4 c1">picture</span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;tag actually...is a new HTML5 feature, and it&#39;s a tag that allows you to have a picture information inside these two tags, that give you multiple sources to be contained for an image element. So, as opposed to the old days when you had the image tag, and you were locked into one single image, the picture tags allows you to have multiple pictures. And the benefits for this are a couple: the first thing is it allows you to actually have multiple images, and this really useful for responsive design. This is why we are talking about it, is that it allows you to have different size images, that will load up depending on the size of the viewport. That&#39;s really, really useful. It also allows you to put something in there if the picture tag isn&#39;t available, or doesn&#39;t work with the specific browser. And so that allows you to make sure that legacy browsers &ndash; or even modern browsers that don&#39;t support the picture tag &ndash; at least give the user some sort of information back.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">[The Adobe Dreamweaver application is displayed.

And so what I mean by that, is that if you have a nice high-res picture and it&#39;s very large &ndash; that&#39;s going to look great on a desktop browser &ndash; that in the picture element will serve that up, or the server will serve that up to the browser. But if you&#39;re operating off a smartphone or tablet, and you have a smaller viewport size, you don&#39;t need to receive all that information. It&#39;s very inefficient. The server&#39;s going to be sending you a very, very high-res picture that you don&#39;t need to see. And so what we can do is this: I&#39;ll go ahead and...just actually before we do this, let&#39;s take a look at our folder. So what I&#39;ve done here is I&#39;ve set three pictures, one called hi_res &ndash; and down here you can see its 1.52 megabytes &ndash; one called low_res, and one called medium_res. And each one is a different size. And so the idea here is that if somebody is using a desktop browser, we want to serve up the high-res image. If somebody is using a tablet, then maybe we want to serve up the medium-res picture. And if they&#39;re using the smartphone, we want to serve up the low-res picture. And again, that&#39;s going to be more efficient, because it&#39;s a smaller file, you can see here its 384 kilobytes. And that is great. It&#39;s a smaller size and it&#39;s a smaller file size as well.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">[In the Dreamweaver application window, the 71103.html tabbed page is open. The presenter navigates to the 71103 folder in File Explorer by clicking the File Explorer icon on the taskbar. This folder displays the 71103 html file and the hi_res, low_res, med_res, and not_supported files. He then selects the hi_res, low_res, and med_res to explain their differences. Next he refers to their sizes that are displayed in the bottom of the 71103 window when each file is selected. The size of the three files is as follows: hi_res: Size 1.52 MB low_res: Size 384 KB med_res: Size 851 KB]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now, finally we have an image that just says &quot;Sorry, your browser is not supported.&quot;, so we want to be able to use that just in case our browser doesn&#39;t support this. So let&#39;s go ahead and create the code inside the picture tag. And it looks like this. You create a tag called </span><span class="c4 c1">source</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">media=;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and in quotation marks, we&#39;re going to start with this; </span><span class="c4 c1">min-width</span><span class="c1">. And here&#39;s where we&#39;re telling the browser that depending on the browser width size, or the viewport size, this is what we wanted to serve up. So </span><span class="c4 c1">1024</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;pixels, so that&#39;s typically what you&#39;re going to have with a desktop browser, so 1024 or higher &ndash; remember this is minimum width &ndash; so it&#39;s going to anything higher the 1024 is going to work as well. And then we do this: </span><span class="c4 c1">srcset=</span><span class="c1">, so source set equals, and then the name of our image, in this case </span><span class="c4 c1">hi_res.png</span><span class="c3 c1">. And then we do the same thing again, I&#39;ll just copy and paste this to make it go a little bit quicker.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">[The 71103 folder is displayed in File Explorer and lists the following files: hi_res low_res med_res not_supported The presenter refers to the not_supported file. He then minimizes the 71103 window and navigates to the 71103.html tabbed page in the Dreamweaver application. He then enters the following code, within the picture tag, starting from line #26: 26 &lt;source media=&quot;(min-width: 1024px)&quot; srcset=&quot;hi_res.png&quot;&gt; 27 &lt;source media=&quot;(min-width: 1024px)&quot; srcset=&quot;hi_res.png&quot;&gt;]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So here the minimum width. We&#39;re going to set, say, </span><span class="c4 c1">750</span><span class="c1">, and this is really sort of dependent or it&#39;s up to you how you to set that width. I&#39;ll say </span><span class="c4 c1">750</span><span class="c1">, but it could change depending on the screen size, say of a tablet, because remember that medium-res is probably going to be the tablet size. We&#39;ll go ahead and change that. Now, rather than have to go through that </span><span class="c4 c1">min-width</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;again, we&#39;ve only got three images and this time, we just say </span><span class="c4 c1">source</span><span class="c1">. We don&#39;t have to do that anymore, we just say, </span><span class="c4 c1">srcset</span><span class="c1">, we don&#39;t need to set the media query, all we want to do is we have our third image, </span><span class="c4 c1">low_res.png</span><span class="c1">. So just to reiterate, this one will serve up to a browser window that&#39;s </span><span class="c4 c1">1024</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;pixels, or wider or larger, this one will serve up to a browser that&#39;s </span><span class="c4 c1">750</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;pixels to </span><span class="c4 c1">1023</span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;pixels, and this will serve up to anything lower than 749 pixels. And you can have as many as you want by the way, I&#39;m just using three images here, but if you&#39;re really ambitious you can have multiple sized images. Now, finally I&#39;m going to put this in. This is very important; image source equals...not supported...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">[The 71103.html tabbed page is open in the Dreamweaver application window.

Now this picture is the high-res version, because the browser window, the viewport, is larger than 1024 pixels. Now, as I start to shrink the viewport &ndash; okay, now we&#39;ve gone to our medium-res image and this would be the one in the tablet. And there is our low-res image, the one that would show up in the smartphone. And that&#39;s the purpose of this great feature, this picture element. It gives you the ability to modify this element according to the viewport size. Very useful in responsive design.

Then the presenter closes the Internet Explorer browser window, navigates to the 71104.html tabbed page in the Dreamweaver application window and enters the following code partially starting from line #18: video { width: }]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c1">100%</span><span class="c1">, we&#39;re using percentage here. Now, what we want to do is put this in as well, and this just let&#39;s the browser know. So it&#39;s exclamation mark </span><span class="c4 c1">Important</span><span class="c1">, and that tells the browser, it&#39;s really important that it does this. It&#39;s going to give this priority over other things that might overwrite it. And then </span><span class="c4 c1">height</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and here we set </span><span class="c4 c1">auto</span><span class="c1">, because remember, we want the aspect ratio of the video to be maintained. So rather than setting 100% and 100%, we&#39;re going to set this to </span><span class="c4 c1">auto</span><span class="c1">. So it&#39;s going to take the lead from whatever width the viewport is, to set the height of the video. It will be correct every time. And again, we&#39;re going to set </span><span class="c4 c1">Important</span><span class="c1">. And I&#39;ll go ahead and save that. Now, if I open the browser again, </span><span class="c0">Allow</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">blocked</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">content</span><span class="c1">, you can see the video now has fit nicely inside that page. Now, it&#39;s not perfect, because we still have to scroll down to see the controls. But there it is. Now, as I resize this viewport, we can see that the video is resizing with it, and that&#39;s really nice. The controls is &ndash; okay, there we go, they&#39;re back. So you can really do a lot with this feature &ndash; I&#39;ll go ahead and stop playing that &ndash; in the sense that you can make your videos responsive, and that&#39;s extremely important. Especially when you think about the different devices, you&#39;re designing for. And it&#39;s all done using these two simple lines and the </span><span class="c4 c1">video</span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;tag in HTML5 and CSS3.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">[The 71104.html tabbed page is open in the Dreamweaver application window.

Explaining media queries</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c1">One of the first things that comes up when you&#39;re discussing responsive web design is media queries. They sound a little mysterious at first but when you understand how to recognize them and how they work, they are the most powerful tool in the web designer&#39;s toolkit. So in this video I&#39;ll introduce you to media queries. The @media rule allows different style rules for different media, all identified in the same style sheet. So for example, this CSS rule, </span><span class="c4 c1">@media</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">screen</span><span class="c1">, will instruct the browser to display the entire page, everything in the body section, at a width of 75% of the browser window. This @media rule uses print to define how the page is handled when it&#39;s printed. Anything you put inside these rules, from font sizes to page layout settings, will be to define the way the browser handles a page. So you could have two sets of looks, one for the way the page is handled when it&#39;s displayed and one for when it&#39;s printed using the @media rule. The two rules we saw in the previous example are only two of the types you can use with that media. Here you can see all the types that are available when creating media queries. The first &ndash; </span><span class="c4 c1">all</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&ndash; is pretty self explanatory. </span><span class="c4 c1">Aural</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;will query speech and sound synthesizers; very useful for creating accessible websites. </span><span class="c4 c1">Braille</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c4 c1">embossed</span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;&ndash; the same. Great for ensuring that your site complies with accessibility standards.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">[Heading: Introducing Media Queries. The following sample code is displayed with the heading &quot;@Media Rule&quot;: @media screen { body { width :75%; } } Then the following code is displayed below the existing code: @media print { body{ width: 100%; } } Next the Media Types are listed in a tabular format with two columns that include Media Type and Description. The media types and their description displayed is as follows: all - All media type devices aural - Speech/sound synthesizers braille - braille tactile feedback devices embossed - Paged braille printers handheld - Handheld devices print - Printers projection - Projected presentations, e.g. slides screen - Computer screens tty - Media using a fixed-pitch character grid, e.g. teletypes and terminals tv - TV devices]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There is a </span><span class="c4 c1">handheld</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;query to check if the device browser is running on a handheld device. </span><span class="c4 c1">Print</span><span class="c1">, of course, is for printing. </span><span class="c4 c1">Projection</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is used to query for presentation scenarios. </span><span class="c4 c1">Screen</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;for main display. </span><span class="c4 c1">Tty</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;for teletype and terminal scenarios. And </span><span class="c4 c1">TV</span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;for TV devices. Now you don&#39;t have to use all these types but, depending on your needs and your client-base, they are available to you. And keep in mind that the browser being queried needs to be compatible and recognize the various media types. The big ones, the HTML5 and CSS3 browsers, tend to be compatible out of the box. But it never hurts to check when you&#39;re developing your site. Breakpoints refer to the points where your site content should respond to a browser with the best possible layout for the device&#39;s screen size. So for example, you have a smartphone with a screen size of 320px by 480px. A tablet with a screen of 768px by 1024px. And a laptop or a desktop computer, where you can just assume that the horizontal resolution will be a 1024 pixels or higher. But let me caution that using stock screen sizes is the wrong way to go about it. Devices have all sorts of different sizes these days and trying to design for specific devices poses lots of logistical nightmares. What you want to do is approach design starting with your smallest device size and use major and minor breakpoints to define your layouts.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c1">Major breakpoints determine when a major change in your design is triggered. So at some point, as the screen size increases or decreases, at that point it will become broken; it just won&#39;t look right. And at that point, changes are triggered so the site reformats itself to work with the screen size. An example of this would be if the device accessing your site got small enough, you&#39;d have to change the number of columns from three to two. Minor breakpoints determine when small changes in your design are required. The same idea as major breakpoints. But now instead talking about some kind of major structural change, like the number of columns, or instead looking at changing the way a label is presented with a form element, or how a caption under an image is handled, or how a certain font size is treated. This could be a change in size or a location. But in responsive design, we need to be aware of the minor issues that occur when a browser size changes, just as much as we have to be aware of the major issues.</span></p><p class="c14 c9"><span class="c27 c9"><a class="c25" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cdnlibrary.skillport.com/courseware/Content/cca/wd_rwds_a01_it_enus/output/html/course_transcript.html%23top&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1621689757971000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2Kqc3k1LNbEKfNIf4aC2st">Back to top</a></span></p><h2 class="c8 c6" id="h.cr6lywz7oka4"><span class="c16">Media Queries and Dimensions</span></h2><h3 class="c19 c9" id="h.iyy7b3sbstky"><span class="c12 c1">Learning Objective</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">After completing this topic, you should be able to</span></p><ul class="c7 lst-kix_4ivmej6uv417-0 start"><li class="c20 c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1">use media queries with device or viewport dimensions</span></li></ul><h3 class="c13 c9" id="h.awbmvf2zuhex"><span class="c18">1. Exploring media queries and dimensions</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In this video I&#39;ll discuss media queries and dimensions. Media queries can be put into a style sheet. So I&#39;ll go ahead and create </span><span class="c4 c1">style</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;tag in the head section of our document. And inside those </span><span class="c4 c1">style</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;tags we put our media query and it looks like this: we use the </span><span class="c4 c1">@</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;symbol and then the word </span><span class="c4 c1">media</span><span class="c1">. And then in parenthesis afterwards we put whatever it is that we want to define as our media query. Now I&#39;m going to go ahead and just fill this out, so it looks like a style sheet. So for example, there is your standard style sheet with the opening/closing braces, but instead of a style now we&#39;ve actually got the word </span><span class="c4 c1">media</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;followed by these parenthesis. Now what goes in the parenthesis? Well it&#39;s really up to you. There are a number of different attributes we can use. We can use </span><span class="c4 c1">min-width</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;just like that and something like this. So I&#39;ll just say </span><span class="c4 c1">500px</span><span class="c1">. Now what does that mean? Well </span><span class="c4 c1">min-width</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is going to define or tell the browser that that&#39;s the minimum width that this style sheet should be used as. So in other words, as long as the browser window is 500 pixels wide or wider, that this should be used. If it goes below 500 pixels, then don&#39;t use this particular set of styles; that&#39;s </span><span class="c4 c1">min-width</span><span class="c3 c1">. There&#39;s also...I&#39;ll go ahead and change this,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">[The Adobe Dreamweaver application is displayed. This application includes a menu bar that consists of the following menus: File, Edit, View, Insert, Modify, Format, Commands, Site, Window, and Help. The Compact drop-down is displayed in line with the menu bar. The following tab is displayed below the menu bar: 71106.html. The 71106.html tabbed page is currently open and includes the following view options: Code, Split, Design, and Live. The Split view is already selected. The Title is set to Responsive Web Design. As the Code view is currently active, the code editor of the file is visible. The panel on the right in the application window includes multiple tabs. The following tabs are displayed at the top in the panel: Insert and Files. The Insert tab is already selected and includes the Structure node, which is expanded and includes the following options: Div, Unordered List, Ordered List, List Item, Header, and Heading. The following tabs are displayed at the bottom in the panel: CSS Designer and CSS Transitions. The CSS Designer tab is selected. The CSS Designer tabbed page includes the following sections, which are collapsible: Sources, @Media, Selectors, and Properties. The code editor of the 71106.html tabbed page includes the following code: 1 &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt; 2 &lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt; 3 4 &lt;head&gt; 5 &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=utf-8&quot;&gt; 6 &lt;title&gt;Responsive Web Design&lt;/title&gt; 7 &lt;/head&gt; 8 9 &lt;body&gt; 10 &lt;div id=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt; 11 12 &lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt; 13 &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 14 &lt;/div&gt; 15 16 &lt;/div&gt; 17 &lt;/body&gt; 18 &lt;/html&gt; 19 20 In the code editor, the presenter adds a line space after line #7 and enters the following from line #7: &lt;style&gt; @media (min-width: 500px) { } &lt;/style&gt; Then he modifies the code on line #8 by replacing &#39;min&#39; with &#39;max&#39; in the code statement.]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c1">max-width</span><span class="c1">. Now </span><span class="c4 c1">max-width</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is exactly what you&#39;d expect. If the browser window goes below 500 pixels, then use the style sheet. So 499 pixels or narrower, it&#39;s going to use this particular set of styles. There&#39;s also </span><span class="c4 c1">min</span><span class="c1">, dash, </span><span class="c4 c1">height</span><span class="c1">. Now </span><span class="c4 c1">min</span><span class="c1">, dash, </span><span class="c4 c1">height</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is the same thing as </span><span class="c4 c1">mid</span><span class="c1">, dash, </span><span class="c4 c1">width</span><span class="c1">, except now we&#39;re talking about the height of the browser window instead of the width of it. And then there&#39;s </span><span class="c4 c1">max</span><span class="c1">, dot, </span><span class="c4 c1">height</span><span class="c1">. And again same idea that is going to be if the browser window is 499 pixels tall or shorter, then use this particular set of styles. Now in addition to that we also have something else we can use. I&#39;ll go ahead and just show you. You could do this; so </span><span class="c4 c1">orientation:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">portrait</span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;is going to say that the height is greater than or equal to the width. In other words, we&#39;re in portrait view now, so anytime...and this is of course going to be useful for mobile devices like tablets and smartphones. If we&#39;re in portrait mode, use this set of styles. And then if we&#39;re in landscape mode,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">[The 71106.html tabbed page is open in the Dreamweaver application window. In the code editor, the presenter had modified the code on line #8 as follows: @media (max-width: 500px) { He then modifies this code statement as follows: @media (min-height: 500px) { Next he modifies this code statement as follows: @media (max-height: 500px) { He further makes changes to this code statement and the modified code statement on line #8 is now displayed as follows: @media (Orientation: portrait) { Next he modifies this code statement by replacing &#39;portrait&#39; with &#39;landscape&#39; and the code statement on line #8 is displayed as follows: @media (Orientation: landscape) {]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">then use that set of styles. So if somebody turns the phone or tablet sideways, so we&#39;re looking at it lengthwise, then use this particular set of styles. So we can use all these different variance when we&#39;re setting up our media queries and we can use combinations of them as well, but just for this, the purposes of this, I&#39;ll show you how this works. So </span><span class="c4 c1">min</span><span class="c1">, dash, </span><span class="c4 c1">width</span><span class="c1">, and let&#39;s say </span><span class="c4 c1">640px</span><span class="c1">. This is all entirely dependent on you. So you have to decide what your various widths and sizes are going to be. And, you know, really it&#39;s not rocket science, you have to figure out what the approximate dimensions of your average smartphone, your average tablet, and your average desktop or laptop computer are, and then work from there. You don&#39;t have to get too elaborate. You don&#39;t have to start putting in dimensions for every single device. As a matter of fact that&#39;s very counterintuitive, you want to sort of keep it as flexible and as efficient as possible. But now that I&#39;ve done this, what I am saying is, okay, so we want the browser width to be at a bare minimum, 640 pixels. At 639 pixels the set of styles here isn&#39;t going to work. It&#39;s only going to work if the browser width is 640 pixels or higher. And then I can go ahead and start to add my particular styles. So for instance, if I wanted to set the </span><span class="c4 c1">body</span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;tag and set, say, a font size,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">[The 71106.html tabbed page is open in the Dreamweaver application window. In the code editor, the presenter modifies the code statement on line #8 as follows: @media (min-width: 640px) { Then he adds the following code starting from line #9: 9 body { 10 11 }]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">or let&#39;s say, a font family. So I&#39;ll say, </span><span class="c4 c1">font</span><span class="c1">, dash, </span><span class="c4 c1">family</span><span class="c3 c1">, and choose this. Then this particular set of font styles, any of those styles, are going to be applied as long as this media rule has been triggered. And again, if it gets smaller than 640 pixels maybe you want to go with a different font style, the font style that&#39;s better displayed at something lower than 640 pixels. And any set of rules you put inside here are going to apply anytime that browser width becomes 640 pixels or higher. So that&#39;s the benefit of the media query and how you set things like dimensions and orientation, and once they become familiar with how they work, you can start setting up your web pages for responsive design.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">[The 71106.html tabbed page is open in the Dreamweaver application window.

The meta viewport tag instructs a browser to treat the viewport size. And this means that you can use the tag that&#39;s at the viewport at the width or height of the device being used, and that means responsiveness. So here&#39;s what it looks like. It goes in the head section and it is meta tag, </span><span class="c4 c1">meta</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">name=&quot;viewport&quot;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">content=</span><span class="c3 c1">; and whatever we need to put there; width equals...I&#39;ll use device, dash, width. And I&#39;m going to add this as well and explain this why, I&#39;m doing this; initial scale; initial, dash, scale equals 1. Now I&#39;ll go ahead and close that meta tag. Now what we&#39;re doing here is instructing the browser to set the viewport width. And remember I used width or content = device width right here. We&#39;re setting the width, at whatever width the device browser is reporting. So if it&#39;s a smartphone, it will be the width of that device, and if it&#39;s a tablet, it will be the width of that device.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">[The Adobe Dreamweaver application is displayed.

Now as far as the content portion goes, I&#39;ve used device width here, </span><span class="c4 c1">width=device-width</span><span class="c3 c1">.

So I could go ahead and set that device value and that would set it there. We also have things like...I can get rid of that. We have height, okay.

And finally I&#39;ll go ahead and just move on from that because that pretty much explains the meta tag for viewport. Finally you&#39;re going to want to probably do this as well. This is not absolutely necessary, but it&#39;s something that&#39;s probably worth mentioning that you can add this to your CSS, go ahead and put this in. So @, dash, ms, dash, viewport; notice we&#39;re using that viewport name again, but now we&#39;re setting a CSS function up here. And here I&#39;m just going to put this </span><span class="c4 c1">width:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">device</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;like that. And I&#39;m going to go back here and just reset this to where it was before. So </span><span class="c4 c1">width</span><span class="c3 c1">, so it&#39;s consistent. I&#39;ll explain what I&#39;m doing here.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">[The 71107.html tabbed page is open in the Dreamweaver application. The presenter refers to the following code statement on line #6: &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;device-height, initial-scale=1&quot;&gt; Then the presenter adds a line space on line #8 and enters the following code starting from line #8: &lt;style&gt; @-ms-viewport { width: device-width; } &lt;/style&gt; Next he modifies the code statement &#39;&lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;device-height, initial-scale=1&quot;&gt;&#39; on line #6 as follows: &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1&quot;&gt;]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c1">Now what this does...the ms, dash, viewport rule...media query actually is a fix for Internet Explorer 10. When IE 10 enters snap mode, so if you&#39;re dragging to the edge of the screen, the left or right edge, it&#39;s going to snap into place and the browser window is automatically going to change to 320 pixels wide. And some developers sort of realized that this could be problematic because suddenly you&#39;re snapping into place and it wasn&#39;t helping our efforts in terms of responsive design. And so somebody came up with this fix and it&#39;s a pretty slick one, it just tells the IE 10 browser that when it goes into snap mode to reset the set of styles. And again what we&#39;d have to do here is go ahead and start putting some styles in here in order to allow for that, like using a media query for that particular screen size, but at least that gives us the ability to do that using the ms, dash, viewport rule. So viewport allows you to have that responsiveness. It&#39;s little different than media queries in the sense that it&#39;s not quite as elegant, I guess, is one way of putting it. You can use it. There certainly are arguments for using both. So get familiar with the viewport setting, understand how media queries work, and that will certainly help you in your responsive design efforts.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">[The 71107.html tabbed page is open in the Dreamweaver application.

Configuring a media query</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In this video I&#39;ll discuss media queries and screen resolution. Now when we set up media queries, we do this. We create a style sheet. This is the one way of doing it. There are other ways as well, but this is sort of the most common method when you&#39;re starting to get into it. And then when we start to have really long style sheets for different screen sizes, then we&#39;re going to have to create external style sheets but right now we do this inline. So what we do is we use the </span><span class="c4 c1">@media</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;rule, right here, and then we would go ahead and start to enter the information. And that information will be things like width, and height, and orientation, and they&#39;re going to query the browser that&#39;s loading up this web page and say, okay, what screen width are you, or what height, or what orientation, whatever is relevant; and then apply the rules that apply to that specific scenario. Now the thing is that when we talk about media queries they&#39;re really most useful when you&#39;re using multiple ones; having a single media query really doesn&#39;t do a lot because it only applies to one scenario. So what I want to do here is just show you how we would set up media queries for something like a smartphone, for instance. And this is just a smartphone so you&#39;ll still have to set up things for tablets and browsers, but this is how you would do it for say, just one device. And what I&#39;ll do is go ahead and do this &ndash; </span><span class="c4 c1">@media</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">only</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">screen</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">and</span><span class="c3 c1">.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">[The Adobe Dreamweaver application is displayed.

And what I&#39;m doing here is saying, I want the media only, okay, so we&#39;re talking about only the screen. And we use, </span><span class="c4 c1">and</span><span class="c1">, to separate or use </span><span class="c4 c1">and</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">or</span><span class="c1">, </span><span class="c4 c1">or</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to separate the various options we have here for resolution. So in this case I&#39;m saying and, min, dash, device, dash, width: 320px. Okay, you know, so I mean there&#39;s no specific setting. Well there are some general settings for dimensions for smartphones, but not specific, because remember every screen is different. Smartphones vary in size and they vary in screen resolution, so you sort of have to be judicious in the way that you approach this. And so I&#39;m going to use 320, sort of as our minimum device width target and understand that those values are guesses really, they&#39;re not actual fixed values. By using the value to 320 pixels that&#39;s not going to cover every single smartphone out there, but that&#39;s just a way of sort of developing your responsiveness without getting into designing for every single device, which is an absolute no-no, because you&#39;ll go crazy doing it...I guess is the bottomline here. So let&#39;s go ahead and use, </span><span class="c4 c1">and</span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;again.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">[The 71108.html tabbed page is open in the Dreamweaver application is open window. The presenter modifies the code on line #8 as follows: 8 @media only screen and (min-device-width: 320px) and]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And then </span><span class="c4 c1">max</span><span class="c3 c1">; see what I&#39;m doing here, okay, so I&#39;m adding another rule. And this time it&#39;s going to be the maxium device width, 480px. Now what this does is this sets up our scenario for a smartphone where it&#39;s saying, okay, use these particular rules...go ahead and put in our braces here...because everything inside those braces are going to be applied when we have a scenario where we&#39;ve got a device whose minimum device width is 320 pixels and its maximum device width is 480 pixels. So 320 or higher, 480 or lower, and it&#39;s going to fit within that particular screen size and that will capture, by the way, a lot of different smartphones as long as they all have their screen resolution within those dimensions. And I&#39;ll go ahead and just create a dummy rule here, let&#39;s say for body, okay. So we&#39;re just going to modify the body tag and say for the body tag here we want the background color to be something, I&#39;ll just use something like this. That looks pretty good.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">[The 71108.html tabbed page is open in the Dreamweaver application window. The presenter modifies the code on line #8 as follows: 8 @media only screen and (min-device-width: 320px) and (max-device-width: 480px) { 9 10 } He then adds a line space after line #9 and enters the following code starting from line #9: 9 body { 10 background-color: 11 } He then opens the color palette and selects a color. As a result, the code statement on line #10 is completed as follows: 10 background-color: #863233;]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Okay. So in this particular scenario, if we hit these target resolutions in between this, and in between this, the background color is going to change to this particular color, sort of a pale red. And any rules that we put inside this closing brace and this opening brace are going to apply in that specific scenario and that&#39;s how we do it with responsive design. Now keep in mind you can also do it, or set up rules for landscape and portrait as well, this is something that&#39;s really up to you, but I&#39;ll just give you a quick example. So we could do this...</span><span class="c4 c1">@media</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">only</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">screen</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">and</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">(max-width:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">320</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">px)</span><span class="c1">. Like that and there&#39;s...that&#39;s not what I wanted to do. And there&#39;s one rule. And then I&#39;ll do it again for portrait. That looks pretty good. So </span><span class="c4 c1">@media</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">only</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">screen</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">and</span><span class="c1">...didn&#39;t mean to do that. That should be </span><span class="c4 c1">min-width</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and this should be </span><span class="c4 c1">max-width</span><span class="c3 c1">.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">[The 71108.html tabbed page is open in the Dreamweaver application window.

We&#39;ve got a lot of high-definition type screen devices out there, so this may not apply, but this is just an example of how this works. What I&#39;m doing here is essentially saying, okay, I want to set up a scenario where I&#39;ve got a landscape smartphone device; I&#39;ll put a little comment here just so we can understand what&#39;s going on. And here we&#39;ve got portrait. And by doing this what I&#39;m doing is I&#39;m saying, I&#39;m just using </span><span class="c4 c1">min-width</span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;now. So I&#39;m saying, as long as the minimum width of the device is 320 pixels, okay. So 320 pixels or higher, okay, then use the rules that are contained within these braces. But when we go into portrait mode, so we&#39;re changing the orientation of the screen &ndash; we&#39;re changing it from side to side and we&#39;re flipping it &ndash; so it&#39;s taller than it is wide. Then we switch to the portrait mode, which we&#39;re saying the maximum width is 320px. So suddenly now that screen width, that browser width is 320px or lower.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">[The 71108.html tabbed page is open in the Dreamweaver application window.

Setting resolution and media queries and you have to sort of think about all the different devices you want to target and how your layout is going to look and again be very judicious in the way that you approach resolution. You don&#39;t want to put too much work into developing a bunch of different rules that are very granular. Rather sort of pick a range of devices, work with that, that will be your smartphones; another range of devices that work with that, that will be your tablets. And then the remainder is going to be things like desktop and laptop computers.</span></p><p class="c14 c9"><span class="c27 c9"><a class="c25" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cdnlibrary.skillport.com/courseware/Content/cca/wd_rwds_a01_it_enus/output/html/course_transcript.html%23top&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1621689757978000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1576nOkXXZT6tXcufxZRRf">Back to top</a></span></p><h2 class="c8 c6" id="h.3cro98uy3uee"><span class="c16">Working with Multiple Media Queries</span></h2><h3 class="c19 c9" id="h.khcywyqmommd"><span class="c12 c1">Learning Objective</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">After completing this topic, you should be able to</span></p><ul class="c7 lst-kix_j2177nufvh7s-0 start"><li class="c9 c20 li-bullet-0"><span class="c5 c1">work with multiple media queries, combining and negating queries</span></li></ul><h3 class="c13 c9" id="h.gw3j9wgix92g"><span class="c18">1. Using multiple media queries</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In this video, I&#39;m going to discuss working with multiple media queries. Okay. So the power of the media query is to be able to say, find out what device is actually using your webpage. Loading your webpage. And then set rules for that according to that device size. And typically, we&#39;ll be talking about three different types of devices. We&#39;ll be talking about smartphones, tablets and a desktop or laptop computer. And we always start with the lowest device first. So that will be the smartphone. And you can see here I&#39;ve got a media query that covers </span><span class="c4 c1">Smartphones</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">(p</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">and</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">l)</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;both portrait and landscape.

So as long as the screen resolution, the viewport window, is within those dimensions, then the rules that are inside this media query are going to apply to the page. If I move down, we&#39;ve got the same idea for tablet, but now that </span><span class="c4 c1">(min-width:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">768px)</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and the </span><span class="c4 c1">(max-width:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">1024px)</span><span class="c1">. So again, the rules inside here will apply to just those resolutions. And then finally, if I move down, I&#39;ve just got a rule for </span><span class="c4 c1">(min-width:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">1025px)</span><span class="c3 c1">. And this will apply to anything that&#39;s larger in width than 1024 pixels. And that will cover your desktop and your laptop computers. Now, if I go ahead and run this now.

You can see that when we hit that threshold of 1024 pixels or lower, that it&#39;s going to change the color of the content and the color of the container rather, and the text inside this span. And then as I shrink down, something is going to happen here. It&#39;s going to disappear and I&#39;ll get to that in a second. I&#39;ll keep shrinking. And here we reach our threshold of 320 pixels to 480 pixels. And so what&#39;s happened here, is that again, the content has changed and the color has changed. And I&#39;ll just go back and show you. As I increase the size, disappears, then we have our purple, and then we have our larger resolution. So that&#39;s great. That&#39;s exactly how the media query is supposed to work. It&#39;s supposed to modify the page, its contents, its layout, whatever you set inside those rule sets, depending on what the media query is getting back from the browser.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">[The Responsive Web Design tabbed page in the Internet Explorer browser window containing a colored rectangular box with the text &quot;1025px or higher&quot; is displayed. The presenter starts reducing the width of the browser window. As a result, the colored rectangular box starts resizing accordingly and at one point, the color of the rectangular box changes and the text is updated as &quot;Between 768px and 1024px&quot;. Next he further resizes the browser window by reducing its width and at one point, the rectangular box with the text disappears. Then he reduces the width of the browser window further and at a point, a differently colored rectangular box with the text &quot;Between 320px and 480px&quot; is displayed. Next he starts increasing the width of the browser window and the reverse process of different messages and different colored boxes begins. As he is increasing the width, at one point, the box and the text disappear. When he continues to increase the width, the rectangular box with a different color and the text &#39;Between 768px and 1024px is displayed. Next when he further increases the size, the color of the rectangular box again changes and the text &quot;1025px or higher&quot; is displayed.]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c1">Now, we do have a problem here, I&#39;ll go back and shrink down. That at some point, below 768 pixels that we have nothing. And then as I shrink down that above 480 pixels, nothing. So you have to pay attention to your media queries and the values that you put in here. Because what I&#39;ve done here is I&#39;ve set one up for smartphone and I&#39;ve set portrait and landscape and then I&#39;ve set my values at 320 to 480. But between 481 and 767, I&#39;ve got nothing. I&#39;ve got a big jump here. So you have to pay attention to that. Make sure that when you set your media queries up, that you sort of pay attention to that. There&#39;s a couple of ways I could deal with this. I could change this value to say, 481, that&#39;s probably easiest way. I can add a new rule. A new media query in between or two that would cover that sort of broken area, but I&#39;ll just go ahead and change the value of that to 481. Change our text here just to reflect that, save that, and reload the page. And now, you can see that we&#39;ve got our desired results.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">[In the Internet Explorer browser window, the Responsive Web Design tabbed page that has a colored rectangular box with the text &#39;1025px or higher&#39; is open.

So when we set up a media query, we normally set up a style sheet. And I&#39;ll do in line style sheet here, so we&#39;ll be right in the head section of our HTML document. And then we would use the </span><span class="c4 c1">@media</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;selector and then set our media type or just go ahead and put something in like this. So </span><span class="c4 c1">(min-width:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c1">1025px)</span><span class="c1">. And there we go. And what this would do, is it would only activate the rules or use the rules within this media query, when the minimum width of the browser was 1025 pixels or higher. Now, what I want to do here is show you how we can actually use other media types and there are a variety of them. We&#39;ve got </span><span class="c4 c1">all</span><span class="c1">, so we could use the words a-l-l. And I&#39;d have to put in </span><span class="c4 c1">and</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;there. So that&#39;s how it works. Is we actually use the, </span><span class="c4 c1">and</span><span class="c1">, word to let the media query know that we&#39;re using all media types. And then we would put in whatever rules we had here. If we want to set the minimum height as well, we could use, </span><span class="c4 c1">and</span><span class="c1">, and then go ahead and do that. So there&#39;s </span><span class="c4 c1">all</span><span class="c1">.

So if we wanted to set up a specific set of rules for presentations, we could do it here and that would format the HTML page, the webpage.

Now, keep in mind of course, that this assumes that the device being used, the device that&#39;s loading up this page, is going to be aware or able to pass information back to the browser as to what type of device it is. So teletype is only going to work, if we have some sort of device that actually tells the browser, this is a teletype device. Otherwise the service is going up serve up this content, and it&#39;s not going to know that it&#39;s the teletype device, because it&#39;s not capable of reporting that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">[The 71110.html tabbed page is open in the Dreamweaver application window.

Using the color media query returns the number of bits per color of the device that&#39;s accessing a page. Now usually that value is 8, but if it&#39;s not a color device and it&#39;s a monochrome device, the value returned is zero. So for example...now in this example, all color devices will use the stylesheet information inside the braces. You can also use </span><span class="c4 c1">min-color</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c4 c1">max-color</span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;to determine when a stylesheet is applied. This example will have the same effect as the previous example; that is, as long as there is at least one bit per color, then the stylesheet inside the braces will be applied. Monochrome devices won&#39;t use the stylesheet because, remember, monochrome is zero.

In addition to color settings, media queries can also be used to determine the presence of a pointing device like a mouse, as well as the accuracy of the device. So for example...so the styles inside those braces would be applied only if the target browser doesn&#39;t register any kind of pointing device. Useful if you need to have a fallback for users who aren&#39;t using a mouse or other device. The other two options for pointer are: </span><span class="c4 c1">fine</span><span class="c1">, where pointing device is present and considered to be precise, and </span><span class="c4 c1">course</span><span class="c3 c1">, where a pointing device is present, but it is considered to be fairly inaccurate.

Resolving compatibility issues</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c1">In this video, I will discuss media queries and compatibility with older browsers. CSS3 media queries are compatible with the major browsers, but don&#39;t assume that everyone surfing the Web has an up-to-date system and software. Additionally, you need to be aware that mobile browsers may not always play by the rules. Browser engines are built by the software vendors, and what they decide to include or omit is really at the whim of the vendor. Remember that you are always designing for mobile first. This ensures a lightweight web-browsing experience, even as the site grows to desktop proportions. It also ensures that mobile browsers that don&#39;t support media queries are supported because you are giving them the most basic layout. When we create media queries, we set them to trigger at certain points, usually the viewport width, like in this example. So here we have a viewport width set for a minimum width of 320 pixels and a maximum of 480; and here we have 481 to 1024. And then as the screen gets wider than 1024 pixels, then we have some styles in there that sort of take care of the rest of it. So how do we address browsers that don&#39;t support media queries? Well the first thing is for may sound like a copout, but you could just do nothing. You have got a single column-web layout that&#39;s your mobile first solution, and you could just leave it at that. If your clients are using modern devices and browsers, and the risk that someone is going to come along with Windows XP and IE6 are low &ndash; and that&#39;s not a stretch &ndash; then you could just leave it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">[The Adobe Dreamweaver application is displayed.

So now this assumes that we have got a stylesheet called </span><span class="c4 c1">480px.css</span><span class="c3 c1">, and it&#39;s going to apply when our media query triggers that the maximum width is 480 pixels. So anything that&#39;s 480 pixels or smaller is going to use this spreadsheet and then what we do is this. Really simple, I will go ahead and copy that, paste it...paste it one more time, and then change some values here. So we will have one that triggers at a minimum width -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">[The 71112.html tabbed page is open in the Dreamweaver application window. The presenter adds a line space below line #6 and enters the following code on line #7: 7 &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; media=&quot;(max-width: 480px)&quot; href=&quot;480px.css&quot;&gt; He then copies the code statement on line #7 and pastes it on lines #8 and #9, respectively as follows: 8 &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; media=&quot;(max-width: 480px)&quot; href=&quot;480px.css&quot;&gt; 9 &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; media=&quot;(max-width: 480px)&quot; href=&quot;480px.css&quot;&gt; Next he modifies the code statement on line #8 as follows: 8 &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; media=&quot;(min-width: 481px)&quot; href=&quot;481px.css&quot;&gt;]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">of 481 pixels. Now the thing is, we have to make sure that we do this as well. So </span><span class="c4 c1">min-width</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c4 c1">max-width</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;of </span><span class="c4 c1">1024</span><span class="c1">...one thousand and twenty-four pixels. And then this one would capture everything else, </span><span class="c4 c1">1025</span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;on...that looks good. The idea here being of course, that we don&#39;t want to put all our style information in the head section of our document. That gets for a very, very long HTML documents. And the other drawback, of course, is that if you create these stylesheets, you have got to replicate them across multiple HTML documents. It&#39;s really complicated &ndash; any time you make a change, you are going to have to change everything manually. Whereas this way, of course, you just create single stylesheet and then you can use it in multiple documents.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5 c1">[The 71112.html tabbed page is open in the Dreamweaver application.

So we could place it on this stylesheet to grab the fallback position of a noncompliant browser. We put it first, before the media queries, and this style sheet would contain a basic set of layout instructions in the event the target browser doesn&#39;t recognize media queries &ndash; so something like this. There are also solutions for noncompliant browsers &ndash; respond.js, for example, is a lightweight add-on that supports IE6 to 8, and other noncompliant browsers. Now keep in mind that solutions like this aren&#39;t complete. Respond.js only supports </span><span class="c4 c1">min-width</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c4 c1">max-width</span><span class="c3 c1">, and it doesn&#39;t provide support for measurements like ems. There is also css3-mediaqueries.js, a similar solution for supporting older browsers with media queries.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c35">[The 71112.html tabbed page is open in the Dreamweaver application window.
