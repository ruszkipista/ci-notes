    <h1>The Statue of Liberty</h1>
    <p>The Statue of Liberty was built over nine years by French sculptor Auguste Bartholdi.<br>Upon its completion in
        1884 all 350 individual pieces of the statue were packed into <br>214 crates for the long boat ride from France
        to New York.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>The statue arrived in the America several months later and was reconstructed on <br>Liberty Island. Auguste
        Bartholdi thought that the New York harbor was the perfect <br>setting for his masterpiece because it was where
        immigrants got their first view of <br>the New World.</p>
