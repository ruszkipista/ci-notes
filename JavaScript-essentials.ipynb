    "### What JavaScript Is\n",
    "![javascript-is.png](./img/javascript-is.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**JavaScript** is a scripting and programming language that runs in a web browser. Its primary purpose is to make web pages more interactive. A web page, as you currently know it, consists of only two things: HTML, which provides the structure of the page as well as its content, and CSS which provides its visual styling. JavaScript, then, exists to give the web page interactivity. It can do a number of key things to make your web pages more interactive, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Changing HTML content\n",
    "* Updating the attributes of HTML elements, e.g. adding and removing classes\n",
    "* Changing the look of the HTML by modifying the CSS\n",
    "* Showing, hiding, manipulating and animating HTML elements\n",
    "* Sending data to and retrieving data from a server\n",
    "* ...and a whole lot more!\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript was originally intended to run only in the browser, but modern JavaScript doesn't even require a browser to run. Today it can be used as a front end or a backend language interchangeably, or both at the same time. In the past, to handle things like connecting to databases and back end processes like aggregating and manipulating data, you needed to rely on server-side languages like Python or C++, but with the advent of server-side technologies like NodeJS, everything can be done with JavaScript if you so desire. By implementing and using modern mobile application development frameworks, JavaScript can even be used to create mobile apps and browser-based games.\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript permeates every aspect of the web. It's sometimes said that \"Software ate the world, the web ate software, and JavaScript ate the web\" and this really is true in many ways. According to Google, there are nearly 2 billion web pages in existence, and a 2020 survey by W3Techs found that 96.5% of them use JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this deep integration with everything web-based, JavaScript is sometimes called the \"standard programming language of the web\". It's not just restricted to the web these days either. JavaScript and its related technologies are used in tablets, smartphones, and even smart TVs. Some of the biggest companies in the world whose websites you use everyday use JavaScript, including Facebook, Google, Amazon and YouTube. Chances are, if you've ever seen any sort of interactive content on a website - automatically validating forms, photo slideshows, comments that post without reloading the page - it was built at least in part with JavaScript."

    "### Frameworks and Libraries\n",
    "One of the main reasons you should learn JavaScript is that without understanding JavaScript on its own (sometimes called vanilla JavaScript) none of the frameworks or libraries that are based on JavaScript will make sense. Before going further though, let's define what frameworks and libraries are.\n",
    "\n",
    "![frameworks+and+libraries.png](./img/frameworks+and+libraries.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Both frameworks and libraries are collections of functions and blocks of reusable code that make software development faster and easier. They are developed in response to many developers who need to accomplish the same tasks becoming tired of rewriting the same code over and over. To solve the problem, eventually a developer decides to wrap all their repetitive code up in a collection of functions and makes it available for use to everyone who wants to accomplish the same thing...thus a framework or a library is born. There are frameworks and libraries for many languages too, not just JavaScript. While they have similar purposes though, frameworks and libraries are different:\n",
    "\n",
    "A library is simply a collection of functions and utilities grouped together which you can use at will, without much regard to adapting your project to fit the library. With a library you are in control of when to use each component, and you can use as many of those components as you wish or none at all. Two of the most popular JavaScript libraries include jQuery and ReactJS.\n",
    "\n",
    "A framework, on the other hand is like a blueprint or a set of rules used to develop an application. When using a framework, you are filling in the blanks in order to complete the story, but the framework dictates the things that must be filled in, and how. The framework gives you the structure and handles all the interaction, and requires you to tell it the details. Popular JavaScript frameworks include Vue.js, Ember, and AngularJS.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a good analogy for understanding the difference between frameworks and libraries: A library is like Ikea: you've already got a house, but you need some furniture. You don't want to make all your furniture from scratch, so you go to the store to buy some pre-made or easy-to-assemble furniture. In this way you are treating the furniture store as a library of furniture. On the other hand, a framework is like someone handing you a few blueprints for a home and asking you to choose between different floorplans, layouts, and sizes. You have a few options to choose from, but the framework decides how the home will be constructed and will allow you to input specific properties such as what color the walls should be, what type of counter tops you'd like, the layout of the cabinetry and so on. The main reason you need to know JavaScript is that without understanding vanilla JavaScript, any frameworks or libraries you want to use in the future which depend on it will be filled with code you don't understand. Once you're comfortable with vanilla JavaScript, learning to use advanced libraries and frameworks like jQuery, React and Angular becomes much easier."

    "### Dev Tools and `console.log()`\n",
    "#### Developer tools on different browsers\n",
    "Every modern web browser includes its own set of developer tools.\n",
    "##### Mozilla Firefox\n",
    "Firefox Developer Tools allow you to examine, edit, and debug HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the desktop and on mobile. Also, you can download a version of of Firefox called Firefox Developer Edition that is tailored for developers, featuring the latest Firefox features and experimental developer tools. Learn more about Mozilla Firefox DevTools here.\n",
    "\n",
    "To open Firefox Developer Tools, either right-click on any page element and select Inspect Element or open the Firefox settings menu in the top-right corner of your browser window and select Developer. Alternatively, you can use the shortcuts:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Ctrl + Shift + i (Windows/Linux).\n",
    "    \n",
    "##### Google Chrome\n",
    "The Chrome DevTools are a set of web authoring and debugging tools built into Google Chrome. Use the DevTools to iterate, debug and profile your site. Learn more about Chrome DevTools here.\n",
    "We'll begin with explaining dev tools, because that's where the output of `console.log()` will end up anyway. To access Chrome's developer tools, on any webpage simply right click and select \"Inspect\", or just press F12 on your keyboard, or open the Chrome settings menu in the top-right corner of your browser window and select More Tools > Developer Tools. Alternatively, you can use the shortcuts:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Ctrl + Shift + i (Windows/Linux).\n",
    "\n",
    "This will open a new panel in your browser with several tabs in it. Depending on your configuration it may also open in a new window. Once it's open you can choose to dock it on the top, bottom, left, right or open it in a new window. If this is your first time using it, be sure to spend a bit of time exploring and experimenting to become familiar with all the menus and basic navigation around the window. Nothing you change in dev tools will have any permanent effect so it's a great way to learn and explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dev tools is divided into several tabs and has a lot of functionality, but don't be intimidated; you won't need it all and anything you will need frequently will be explained right here. The main tabs you'll find useful as you learn JavaScript and a brief description of their purpose follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Elements**: Provides you with all the HTML markup for the page you're inspecting. You can hover over elements to highlight and identify them on the page, edit or delete elements, or even copy them to be pasted into your code editor. Additionally down the right side of this tab you can modify the CSS for any element you have selected, or add/remove CSS rules for the page as a whole. Anything you do here is temporary and will be reset when you refresh the page, so it's a great place for experimentation.\n",
    "* **Console**: The console tab allows you to see every request as it is made to the HTTP server when you request the website. It will display a log of requests, warnings and errors as the page loads. Critically, it also gives the output of the `console.log()` function a place to go. This means that any time you need to see what's going on in your JavaScript code you can `console.log()` it and it will show up in the console tab when you load the page with dev tools open. Because JavaScript runs directly in the browser, you can also use the console to test JavaScript code right in the browser!\n",
    "* **Network**: Finally, this tab shows you the HTTP status of every request to get every file the website needs. The most useful purpose of this tab is inspecting whether files your site needs - such as CSS and JavaScript files - are being retrieved correctly (an HTTP 200 response), or whether they are not found (HTTP 404). This tab is very useful to figure out why your CSS or JavaScript code isn't working as expected."

    "### Displaying Alerts\n",
    "The `alert()` method in JavaScript is usually one of the first methods new JavaScript developers learn, because it immediately demonstrates something interactive that can be done with JavaScript. To illustrate, right click this page, click inspect, and select the console tab of the developer tools. Once in the console tab, type `alert(\"hello!\");` at the bottom of the console at the prompt, and press enter. Your alert should be displayed as a pop up message in the browser with an OK button.\n",
    "\n",
    "![displaying+alerts.png](./img/displaying+alerts.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `alert()` method is a built in part of JavaScript and is attached to the global `window` object. You might remember that in JavaScript and other object oriented programming languages, *everything is an object*, even the browser window itself! **Window** ([MDN Link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window)) represents the currently selected browser tab and it makes a plethora of attributes, methods and other objects available to the user via JavaScript. A few things that will probably already be familiar to you which are part of the global Window object are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `window.innerHeight` and `window.innerWidth` - The height and width of the browser not including any menus/scrollbars.\n",
    "* `window.location.href` - The current URL in the address bar.\n",
    "*`window.history` - An object representing the history of this tab, providing methods like `history.back()`, the equivalent of pressing the back button.\n",
    "* `window.alert()` - The alert method you just used.\n",
    "* `window.prompt()` and `window.confirm()` - Similar popups as `window.alert()`, but for prompting for user input and getting user confirmation, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also included in the global `window` object is a representation of the entire HTML document loaded in the current tab, accessible with `window.document`. The point of understanding all this is that in JavaScript, everything you'll need for manipulating the **DOM** ([Document Object Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/DOM)) and making your webpages interactive stems from this `window` object. It provides a huge portion of what you'll need as you learn JavaScript, including this `alert()` method, so take some time and peruse the MDN link above to see what else you've got available to work with. The `alert()` utilized here can be handy for logging or alerting items as well, similar to using `console.log`, if you'd like to display some data in an alert box either for testing purposes or to provide some sort of feedback to the user in an obvious way."

When you need to step through your code line by line, you can use the `debugger` keyword.

Just set the breakpoint, add a little JavaScript to execute before it, and then step through the code.

    "### Strings\n",
    "Strings are a collection of characters enclosed inside double or single quotes. You can use strings to represent data like sentences, names, addresses, and more. It is correct to either use double \" or single ' quotes with strings, as long as you're consistent. The [JavaScript Udacity style guide for labs and projects](http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/javascript.html) suggests using single quotes to define string literals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings can be created by surrounding a string of text in either single quotes or double quotes, like this:\n",
    "```JavaScript\n",
    "'This is a string!'\n",
    "\"This is a string, too!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "The type of quotation marks you use doesn't matter, though most developers these days prefer single quotes since it's one less keystroke (you don't have to hold down shift).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to include a literal quotation mark in your string of text, you must enclose the string in the opposite kind:\n",
    "```JavaScript\n",
    "\"This string's got a single quote in it.\"\n",
    "'The developer said, \"Strings are awesome!\"'\n",
    "```\n",
    "The reason for this is obvious if we look at a couple strings:\n",
    "```JavaScript\n",
    "'This one doesn't work'\n",
    "```\n",
    "JavaScript doesn't know whether the single quote in `doesn't` is the closing quote from the beginning of the string, or the apostrophe in the word itself.\n",
    "```JavaScript\n",
    "\"He said \"My name is Bob\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "JavaScript will interpret the double quote just before `\"My name is` as the closing quote matching the one at the beginning of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of the above situations will generate syntax errors, so you do need to be strategic in which quotes you choose, depending on the text of your string.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Escaping characters\n",
    "There is an other way to use quotes *inside a string*, and have JavaScript not misunderstand your intentions, you’ll need a different way to write quotes using the backslash character `\\`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In JavaScript, you use the backslash to **escape** other characters. Escaping a character tells JavaScript to ignore the character's special meaning and just use the literal value of the character. This is helpful for characters that have special meanings like in our previous example with quotes `\"…\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because quotes are used to signify the beginning and end of a string, you can use the backslash character to escape the quotes in order to access the literal quote character. This guarantees that the JavaScript engine doesn’t misinterpret the string and result in an error."

When you need to use a lot of special characters in your string, or maybe even include a variable, you can use a template literal instead.\n",

    "Creating a template literal is easy. All you have to do is surround the string with backticks(\\`\\`) instead of single or double quotes. Between the backticks you can use any characters you want including newlines, tabs, quotes and even variables! The interpreter will interpret the string as it's written in the code, which makes this type of string ideal for creating strings of HTML in your JavaScript, while keeping the HTML itself easy to read. A good example of this would be if you wanted to use JavaScript to render a list of something in an HTML list:\n",

Any code that exists at the top level of your application, anything that is not inside any function, loop, conditional statement and so on, has global scope.\n",
    "- **Function (Local) scope** - When a particular variable is visible (can be used) within a particular function only. Such a variable is generally called as **Local variable**. Any code that exists inside a set of curly braces, for example, code contained within the opening and closing braces of a loop, a conditional statement, or a function, has local scope.\n",
    "- **Block scope** - When a particular variable is visible (can be used) within a pair of `{ ... }` (block of code) only. This is similar to local scope, but refers specifically to the code block the variable exists in. This is relevant when there is nesting in your code, where a variable inside a function might be local, but inside an if statement or loop within the function, anything declared is local only to the loop code blocks. Another way to think about it is that the furthest level out in your code is global scope, the next level in is local, but if within the local scope there is another level of code like a loop, if statement, etc, then the \"local\" scope in the function is now somewhat like the function's \"global\" scope, and anything further in is block scope.\n",

    "let globalVar = 'a global variable';\n",
    "function myFunction() {\n",

    "Above, the two block-scoped variables are accessible only within their respective code blocks, bounded by the curly braces. The local variable is accessible anywhere in the function, and the global variable is accessible anywhere in the entire script. Scope is not just a construct of JavaScript either. As you learned in the comparative programming module, Python also uses code blocks, but instead of being bounded by curly braces they are bounded by the indentation level. That means that in Python, anything at the outermost indentation level is considered global and anything indented is local to that specific indentation level. As you work with these languages more and more, scope will become more clear. When you're writing code, remember to always keep in mind the scope in which you're writing, especially when defining variables. Your code's functionality is dependent on everything having the proper scope."

    "const john = {name: \"John\", age: 30, location: \"US\"};\n",

    "Constants should be used to store data that won't change. If the data might change, use `let` instead.

    "The final way to declare a variable in JavaScript is using the `var` keyword. In modern JavaScript it's usually considered a bad practice to use this declaration, because it creates a variable which has **global** scope, which means it can be unintentionally changed outside of its own scope. Despite this, there are some situations where this type of variable is actually required, so it's good to know it exists and how to use it.\n",

    "Do you see the problem? If not, you're not alone, but look closely at what happened: On line 1 we declared a variable, `i`, using `var`, and gave it a value of `0`. Then on line 3 we initiated a `for` loop, declaring a variable `i` beginning with zero and iterating through `5`, incrementing `i` after each iteration. When the `i` in the loop is equal to `5`, iteration stops, and the final increment takes place `i++`, incrementing it to `6`. However, when we logged `i` to the console outside the loop, `i` has a value of `6`! It has been overwritten by the loop's `i`. This is because variables declared with `var` are not restricted with regard to being *reassigned*, *redeclared*, or *reused* in another scope.\n",

The original variable, which should have maintained a value of `0` was lost. If you were to declare the first variable with `let` or `const`, you would have received an error when you tried to redeclare it with the same name in the for loop, preventing this issue.

When you need to modify a variable's value you can either reassign it as demonstrated above, or use one of the compound assignment operators such as `+=` or `-=`, which take in the original value, modify it accordingly, and then return the new value. Here are the assignment operators you'll use most often (note that the compound assignment operators require that you first use the regular assignment operator to declare the variable and assign its initial value):\n",

However, before it hits this `if` statement, there is another `while` loop set to iterate a variable `inner` from `0` to `100`. Within that loop is an `if` statement that checks each iteration to see if `inner === 3`. If that condition is true it will break the outer loop using the label `outerLoop`!\n",

This technique is not widely used, but if you find yourself in a situation where you need to break out of a specific loop, remember that you can label your loops and attach that label to a `break` or `continue` statement later on."

    "3. The code to execute, enclosed in { curly braces }\n",

If one gets to be too complex, it might mean that some of its code could also be split off into its own function. You can also `return` anything you want.

However, what this code will produce is a `<header>` element with three `<div>` but with the numbers `1`, `2`, and `4` (not `3`) and a `<footer>` element with the number `3`...these are very different results. But it's happening because both functions depend on the `counter` variable and both update it.\n",

Write your variables inside of the functions that need them, keeping them as close to where they are needed as possible.

For example, if you want to create another type of `MammaL` that still has a `name`, but says something different (like a dog), you can easily do this using the `extends` keyword to extend the `Mammal` class's functionality into a new class:"

For example, the `Array` is actually a class! Earlier you saw, that they have methods available such as `sort()`, `reverse()` and so on.\n",

    "This is all because variables in JavaScript are traditionally defined in the scope of a function, rather than in the scope of a block. Since entering a function will change scope, any variables defined inside that function are not available outside of that function. Inside a function, all `var` variables are in scope wether they are defined inside or outside of a block (e.g. `{ }`. If a variable is declared with `let` in a block, then that variable is not available ooutside of that block.\n",

    "const symbol = '¥';\n",
    "\n",

    "1. Outside the `displayPrice()` function, as a global variable.\n",
    "2. Inside the `displayPrice()` function, as a local variable.\n",
    "After invoking `displayPrice()` and passing it an argument of `'80'`, the function outputs `'$80'` to the console.\n",
    "\n",

Well, since the variable pointing to `'$'` is declared inside a function (i.e., the \"inner\" scope), it will override any variables of the same name that belong in an outer scope -- such as the global variable pointing to `'¥'`. As a result, `'$80'` is displayed rather than `'¥80'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, if there are any naming overlaps between variables in different contexts, they are all resolved by moving through the scope chain from inner to outer scopes (i.e., local all the way to global).

    "We've seen how using an immediately-invoked function expression creates a private scope that protects variables or methods from being accessed. IIFE's ultimately use the returned functions to access private data within the closure. This works out very well: while these returned functions are publicly-accessible, they still maintain privacy for the variables defined within them!\n",
    "\n",
    "Another great opportunity to use an IFFE is when you want to execute some code without creating extra global variables. However, note that an IIFE is only intended to be invoked once, to create a unique execution context. If you have some code that is expected to be re-used (e.g., a function meant to be executed more than once in the application), declaring the function and then invoking it might be a better option.\n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, if you simply have a one-time task (e.g., initializing an application), an IIFE is a great way to get something done without polluting the global environment with extra variables. Cleaning up the global namespace decreases the chance of collisions with duplicate variable names, after all."

    "JavaScript leverages this secret link -- between an object and its prototype -- to implement inheritance. Consider the following prototype chain:\n",

    "![prototype-chain.png](./img/prototype-chain.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Cat()` constructor function is invoked using the `new` operator, which creates the `bailey` instance (object). Note that the `meow()` method is defined in the prototype of the bailey object's constructor function. The `prototype` is just an object, and all objects created by that constructor are secretly linked to the `prototype`. As such, we can execute `bailey.meow()` as if it were `bailey`'s own method!\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that each function has a `prototype` property, which is really just an object. When this function is invoked as a constructor using the `new` operator, it creates and returns a new object. This object is secretly linked to its constructor's prototype, and this secret link allows the object to access the prototype's properties and methods as if it were its own!\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we know that the `prototype` property just points to a regular object, *that* object itself also has a secret link to *its* prototype. And that prototype object also has reference to its *own* prototype -- and so on. This is how the **prototype chain** is formed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Finding Properties and Methods on the Prototype Chain\n",
    "Whether you're accessing a property (e.g., `bailey.lives`) or invoking a method (e.g., `bailey.meow()`), the JavaScript interpreter looks for them along the prototype chain in a very particular order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, the JavaScript engine will look at the object's own properties. This means that any properties and methods defined directly in the object itself will take precedence over any properties and methods elsewhere if their names are the same (similar to variable shadowing in the scope chain).\n",
    "2. If it doesn't find the property in question, it will then search the object's constructor's prototype for a match.\n",
    "3. If the property doesn't exist in the prototype, the JavaScript engine will continue looking up the chain.\n",
    "4. At the very end of the chain is the `Object()` object, or the top-level parent. If the property still cannot be found, the property is `undefined`.\n",
    "\n",
    "While both approaches work just fine (i.e., any instances created by the constructor function will be able to invoke a `sayName()` method), the second approach is more ideal. By adding methods to the `prototype`, memory is saved as more `Dalmatian` objects are instantiated. Along with being more efficient, we also don't have to update all objects individually should we decide to change a method for all."

    "#### Subclasses\n",
    "One of the benefits of implementing inheritance is that it allows you to *reuse existing* code. By establishing inheritance, we can **subclass**, that is, have a \"child\" object take on most or all of a \"parent\" object's properties while retaining unique properties of its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have a parent `Animal` object, which contains properties like `age` and `weight`. That same `Animal` object can also access methods like `eat` and `sleep`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's also say that we want to create a `Cat` child object. Just like you can with other animals, you can also describe a cat by its *age* or *weight*, and you can also be certain that the cat *eats* and *sleeps* as well. When creating that `Cat` object, then, we can simply re-write and re-implement all those methods and properties from `Animal` -- or, we can save some time and prevent repeated code by having `Cat` inherit those existing properties and methods from `Animal`!\n",
    "\n",
    "Not only can `Cat` take on properties and methods of `Animal`, we can also give `Cat` its own unique properties and methods as well! Perhaps a `Cat` has a unique `lives` property of `9`, or it has a specialized `meow()` method that no `Animal` has.\n",

    "## Extending Object Functionality with Mixins\n",
    "### An Object is Prototype-linked to a Single Object\n",
    "Recall that an object's `.prototype` property points to just one object. This is because JavaScript only supports single inheritance. If there is an object A and an object B, object C can only be prototype-linked to either A _or_ B.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mixins\n",
    "If a JavaScript object can only be prototype-linked to a single object, how can we go about extending properties and methods from multiple different sources? A mixin allows us to just that!\n",
    "\n",
    "A mixin is a technique that takes the properties and methods from one object and copies them over to another object. In other words: a mixin is an technique that provides some useful functionality, but is not meant to be added to the prototype chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Single Source Object\n",
    "The simplest way to implement the mixin pattern is to use [`Object.assign()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign). It is a method that copies an object's own (non-inherited) properties from one or more source objects into a target object, then returns the updated target object. In other words, `Object.assign()` adds to the target object by merging in the source object(s). Consider the following:"
