My father had a small estate in Nottinghamshire; I was the third of five
sons. He sent me to Emmanuel College in Cambridge at fourteen years old,
where I resided three years, and applied myself close to my studies;
but the charge of maintaining me, although I had a very scanty
allowance, being too great for a narrow fortune, I was bound apprentice
to Mr. James Bates, an eminent surgeon in London, with whom I continued
four years; and my father now and then sending me small sums of money, I
laid them out in learning navigation, and other parts of the mathematics
useful to those who intend to travel, as I always believed it would be,
some time or other, my fortune to do. When I left Mr. Bates, I went down
to my father, where, by the assistance of him, and my uncle John and
some other relations, I got forty pounds,[2] and a promise of thirty
pounds a year, to maintain me at Leyden. There I studied physic two
years and seven months, knowing it would be useful in long voyages.
